2005 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Oil Change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajW6d8RU-Q8
hey folks and welcome to they might be
racing today at the shop we've got a uh
2005 Chevy Silverado 1500 with the 5.3 L
engine and we're going to change the oil
on it so first thing we do is up at the
top of the engine uh we're going to go
ahead and take a look at the oil fill
now if you'll come in a little bit
closer the oil fill is a little floppy
here so you want to support it below
with one hand and twist and lift with
the other hand so what we're looking for
is you know white foamy stuff or we're
we're smelling for the smell of gasoline
that'll tell us that something's wrong
inside the engine everything up here
looks okay the O-ring is good the cap is
clean so we're just going to set that
back in place for now that way it's
going to help us drain the oil out so
the next thing we're going to do is go
underneath the truck and start draining
the oil now accessing the oil drain and
oil filter on this truck is
extraordinarily simple uh we don't
actually have it jacked up it's just
sitting here we can easily slide
underneath my wrench is on the oil drain
plug and right next to it is the oil
filter so simply loosen that up and one
thing to be aware of is there are big
exhaust pipes here so if you were doing
this hot in other words if you've been
running the
truck uh be wary of touching the exhaust
pipes because they will burn you
there we
go so we got that out first thing you
want to do is you want to take a look at
the drain plug to make sure everything's
okay oh there's my paper
towels and wow warm warm
warm
warm
so what you want to do is clean it off
check the threads make sure the threads
aren't stretched at
all everything looks good o-ring is good
so that'll seal right back up again
nicely so we're going to sit here for a
sec and let this
drain and then once it's fully drained
we
will put the pan bolt back in and then
we're going to attack the oil
filter okay so we're threading the oil
pan bolt back in I'm just going to take
it this one bit of Shield here gets a
little oil on it at the very
end thread this guy in
place go ahead and tighten it
up and don't over torque this this
should be hand tight plus a little bit
you know I it's if you over torque it
it's going to be a pain in the butt to
get it off the next
time now what we're going to
do is use our adjustable oil filter
wrench to go ahead and grab this
guy oh come on and twist him off and
this one was on extraordinarily
loose so whoever did this oil change
glass not
only uh put the oil pan bolt on too
tight but they put the oil filter on too
loose that's
cute all
right so with these
vertically held oil filters sometimes
they get oil on top of them so you want
to loosen it up and just let any excess
oil drain off if it's
there
and
then once it slowed
down because otherwise if you try to
take this off too quickly you will get
literally bathed in hot
oil all
righty so that's dropped off a fair bit
now let's see what we can do here
now oil filters
are lots of
threads so it's going to take a bit of
turning to get it
off
okay then you tip the oil filter over so
the oil drains out of the oil filter
you're going to let this drain off a
little bit and then you're going to wipe
it clean so next we
will get the new oil filter and prepare
it for
installation all righty so to get your
new oil filter ready get it out of the
box take some oil fresh oil and just run
it around the Rubber
seal like that and once you've got that
done you want to thread it into
place
now again this has got a lot of threads
in it so it'll spin for a
bit eventually it'll start to tighten up
so you want to get it like I said hand
tight plus a little bit and that should
stay good and snug
so the next thing to do is you know
double check that you that's on tight
that's on tight and we'll go ahead and
fill it with
oil all right so now that we've been
underneath we got the new oil filter in
place we got the new we've got the oil
drained and the plug replaced it's time
to fill this thing up now this engine
takes six quarts of oil so I put a
funnel in
place
and we're just going to start filling
her
[Music]
up so once you get your six quarts of
oil
in uh basically what you want to do is
just make a double check on the oil
filter double check on the drain plug if
you're going to do it change your air
filter as well um but basically that's
it that's how to change the oil on this
truck so until next time happy
