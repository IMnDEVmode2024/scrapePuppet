Generate Your Website's Privacy Policy with ChatGPT or Bing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQ6UQPRvEEE
every website needs a privacy policy it
satisfies legal requirements and
relieves growing concerns among users
about data protection with a few of my
principles of prompt engineering you can
generate your privacy policy in a snap
with chat GPT or Bing as always begin by
assigning a role to the chat bot in this
case we'll assign it the role of lawyer
and then we want to issue a
straightforward assignment write a
privacy policy for my website
and then declare an objective for that
assignment we want our privacy policy to
satisfy all legal requirements in the
locations of the website's users and
then lay out a procedure for the chat
bot to collect the information it needs
for the privacy policy we wanted to ask
one question at a time and this is the
point where I've found that Google's
barred chat bot fails despite those
instructions it asks all of its
questions at once and with that
principled prompt Chachi PT or being
will ask a series of questions about
your website then use your responses to
generate a privacy policy that's really
suitable for most sites but if you want
to add an extra bulletproof layer you
can iterate on the result by asking the
chatbot to identify any holes prompted
to analyze the privacy policy above to
identify any omitted legal requirements
