Joe Rogan podcast check it out The Joe Rogan Experience Train by day Joe Rogan
podcast by night all day did you did you
see the US government just released apparently by accident the project Aqua
stuff did you see this no what's that this is crazy yeah I guess we're
rolling are we rolling yeah I can wait until we no no no you can this is just someone just sent me this this is like
project Aqua yeah hold on I'll
um they just released I think by accident how's that happened it's kona
blue you familiar with this no Kona BL is a um it was a program they yeah dude
they I'm going to send this to Homeland Security just released this send it to me I'll send it to Jamie and uh you can
air drop it no I got it right right here I'll just I don't do email or what I don't know how to airdrop anything you
don't do email no I haven't done email in many years
really yeah how do you exist I do text wow just text yeah I don't do email I
don't go on the [ __ ] internet I don't on the TV I'm not into of that but
anyway um no that stuff is bad you know yeah I guess that's my isolation tank I
just stay away from that [ __ ] but anyway that's smart did you text it to me yeah I did I think I did it didn't get to me
yeah it just s it'll it's a big thing um okay
so this is so amazing so this is in there they're talking about this and
this was just released talking about setting up this program kona blue I didn't get it uh this is like a UAP
program of some the medical division will have a small team of medical analysts under the direction of the
chief physician and Deputy Administrator they will organized data into a threat analysis based on medical findings
including but not limited to a deaths and injuries as a result of interaction
with Advanced Aerospace Vehicles here it is B Medical injuries as a result of
other anomalies C collateral injuries psychological effects to family members so they're admitting that people are
dying this just like a tweet from yes is this
it a day or twoo what does that mean other
information do you ever wonder if stuff like this is just disinformation yeah maybe I mean I I wonder if I wonder a
lot of things I'm sure you do but um I would always always assume that a lot of
this stuff is nonsense yeah here's what we know is
that US servicemen have died as a result
of contact with or being in the proximity of these vehicles and we know
that because there are a lot of Suits working their way through the VA system yeah where families you know can't get
compensated for the deaths or injuries to loved ones because it's all under wraps top secret well that's just that's
just a fact okay that that is happening so if there's I guess you know when there are measurable physical effects of
a phenomenon we can say conclusively the phenomenon is real right and
um so yeah I mean it is real I mean I guess we're sort of past the point of like is it real yeah it's real it's it's
real in that there's these things that are moving in very bizarre ways and they
have these propulsion systems that violate what we know about propulsion
systems retrieving data across dimensional SpaceTime develop remote viewing coms
and count countermeasures determined Baseline for physical transport across dimensional space-time barrier rapid
response Medical Teams for UFO interaction events so how do they do this accidentally study conscious
interactions with and control of technology so I got this from someone in
the US government who's who's who's well well look let me let me just start by saying
I you know I don't know anything um but he sent me this the above is 100%
legit I was read into this program but told never to tell anyone it's now been released as you can see um it began as a
result of my old program a
AIP um I signed a document saying I would never talk about Kona and similar efforts I can't believe that a would
have released it look I I you know yeah I mean here's
what we do know is that there's enough going on in the skies but not just the
skies underwater that U the US military has been forced to respond to it so like
move aircraft from one place to another because there are too many of these objects in the sky that's actually
happened Chris melon just wrote a long piece about it um so it's real the
government is not controlling it in fact it's forcing the government DOD to
respond um and we know that there is a a real effort and has been underway for a
long time to to keep the public from knowing about it but that's all known that's established I don't think any
rational person would deny that the question is like what is it actually I mean now is sort of the point you have to ask like what is
this and um you know so that's how much of do you
think is out ours well none of it's ours none of it well I don't know I mean clearly you
know the US government is huge it's the largest human organization there are I think then I think there are 2 million
federal employees and another 10 million Federal contractors so who are effectively government employees but
don't have Civil Service protection for example um so that's 12 million people
in a country of 340 million working for the federal government so it's kind of hard to overstate how big the federal
government is and how well-funded and so to say the government this the government that no of course it's people
within the government um but yeah they're working on all kinds of things
obviously uh that are classified but in general no they they
can't control these objects uh so no it's not American Technology well or
Russian or Chinese it predates you know all of that well some of it does right like for sure the
Kenneth Arnold sightings that was really early on that was like the 19 early 1950s he was seeing these flying saucers
these discs that were moving over mountains well right I mean the prophet Ezekiel writes about it in the first
chapter wheels in the sky yeah that's a crazy one boy when you read that well it is crazy if you if you read it it's like
oh wow you know Andel not just you know the Hebrew scriptures like it's all over every mhm
the viic textas of course so the These Are Spiritual phenomenon there's no evidence they're from another planet I
mean I think that's the op that's the lie that they're from Mars look space
the atmosphere is really well monitored right both for military for defense
reasons but also because like it' be nice to know when asteroids are coming and there's no evidence has never been
any evidence that there are lots of these objects these vehicles coming into our atmosphere from somewhere else some
other planet there's no evidence of that at all H so they're from here and
they've been here for thousands of years whatever they are and um it's pretty clear to me that they're spiritual
entities whatever that means are Supernatural and which is to say Supernaturals means above the natural
above the observable uh nature and um they don't
behave according to the laws of science as as measured by people you know and um
and they've been here for a long time and there's a ton of evidence that are under the ocean and under the ground so like with that fact set what do you
conclude when did you start having this opinion that they they were spiritual
and that they've always been here like when when did this well I didn't know anything about the topic until
2017 and like was that after the New York Times piece no it was before it was
before and the things that I saw I mean like I was and am still a very conventional person I mean I'm 54 I grew
up in this country in California which was like like every assumption about America I
bought completely just completely and I thought that everyone who questioned
those assumptions was bad I just bought into the system completely without even thinking about it and I imagined that I
was like some kind of freeth thinker and you know I'm going against the grain but like thee my core assumptions were the
you know the assumptions fed to me by the culture and the government and I didn't even realize it but anyway I'd never really thought about UFOs at all
and I've been in journalism since I was a kid of course I'd run into a lot of people who had crazy views on a lot of
different topics UFOs 911 circumcision you know like every whack job in the
world you run into when you're covering stuff fluoride fluoride right I just
brushed with non fluoride toothpaste this morning me too um
exactly exactly but probably unlike you I didn't have any opinions like that I
was like fluide come on you know 911 shut up
UFOs you're [ __ ] crazy you know what I mean I just like I had this reflex I'm ashamed of it I'm not bragging about it
but um but it was it was 2017 and really it was the Trump campaign it wasn't that I was like so in love with Trump though
I've always liked Trump because you know he's like hilarious and charming and all that but I wasn't like a Trumper or
anything um but it was watching that campaign and particularly his claim that
they were spying on him and I was like really there not the Intel service and
federal law enforcement FBI do not spy on presidential campaigns like that's so out of the realm that's so crazy like
that could never happen because of course there's no democracy in a system like that and fundamentally we democracy
an imperfect one it kind of Lumbers along you know but like it's not fake and and then that turned out to be
true and I and I knew it was true and that just blew my mind so I began a
process still ongoing of reassessing a lot of other things like okay well if that was not true what else is not true
and what else that they told me was a conspiracy theory might actually have some basis in fact and um and then
someone from you know a DOD employee reached out to me and said actually there's a ton of evidence that this UFO
thing is real and really and so I started doing segments on it um when I worked at at
the TV channel and uh and there was like a lot of mockery but I was like I don't care I'm just going to do this and then
of course the second you start you know better than anybody you start talking about something then people reach out to
you and some of them are deranged but some of them aren't at all so I just
started getting a lot of information from people and meeting with people mostly in private you know come to my
house let's talk and and I decided on the basis of what they told me and then I talked to a lot
of people about it um that actually this is really a very heavyduty question
actually it's not just it's not the little green men question it's like a much bigger question and it's really bad it's really dark and
and then I stopped then I was like I don't want to know anymore because it's not helping me um at all as a person and
I what information did you get that made you feel like it's dark it's so dark well first of all the
deception is always bad like lying is bad in it and it's bad not just in a legal sense in that it can be illegal to
lie but it's bad it's like bad for you like it rots you like being a liar makes
you a bad person when you lie you are serving evil there's a moral quality to it that's
inescapable and very obvious and only like advanced advanced civilizations
ignore that lying is bad and so if you have lying at scale which we have on
this topic it's inherently bad okay so that's the first level the deeper level is what are okay so if they're Spiritual
Beings which I believe they are like it's a binary they're either
you know you're on team good or team bad you can assign any name to it you want but like what are these things are they
good or bad and um and I think some of them are bad and if the US government
knows that or part elements the people within the US government know that then
you know then they're serving a bad force and well when you say spiritual like what what makes you draw that
conclusion that they're spiritual what's the OB I mean spiritual maybe the wrong word Supernatural you know they're beyond nature as we understand it I mean
obviously they are I mean just chart their physical Behavior it doesn't you know it goes outside of what we
understand about physics no visible means of propulsion you know coming at Indescribable speed
hitting the ocean continuing at speeds that are impossible under sea I mean in other words if I if I take a you know 9
mimet r or 762 x 39 and shoot you at 50 yards underwater and a swimming pool and
it's even more intense in salt water because it's denser you could catch the bullet if it even makes it to you right
so if you have a craft any object underwater that's traveling at 500 knots
as measured by sonar right there you're challenging our understanding physics like what is that how can that be so
they've they've tracked that they've tracked things going 500 knots Under the Sea yeah really yeah much much faster
than any object could can actually go under under SE yo for sure oh yeah there's a lot of stuff
going on underwater and um a lot and there's video of these things
coming out of the sky into the water and also emerging from the water right yeah
so it's all so blurry though I don't think it's trans medium
video yeah I don't think some of it's that blurry I think some of it's Crystal Clear um we just don't have access to it
is that what you mean just we haven't seen itre so they have some stuff for sure so but there's just a lot going on
under water and it's it's measured and so whatever I mean these are all again this is like the most obvious observable
level of it but then you just ask yourself like what is this actually and you know if there's been
extensive knowledge of this for decades like maybe 80 years at least if not
going back to the 30s 90 years um you know to what to what end so there are
two possible explanations obvious explanations the first is the one you often hear which is this is so
heavy that if the public were to know about it it would be just disruptive it' be too scary like you don't want to
scare people for no good reason there's nothing we can do about it and you also don't want to suggest that you know the
US military isn't capable of protecting the country the Homeland um and it does suggest that if
you can't control these objects in your airspace and that's known they can't that's known okay then that's just a
limit to the power of the US Military and you don't want to tell people that because then they like won't believe that they're safe I get it
but then there's a deeper level which is like okay what's your relationship with these
things what is the US government's relationship with these things and there's evidence that there is a
relationship and that it's a longstanding and that raises like a lot of questions about intent and um and so
like what is that and I just personally decided um you know and and people have
been hurt by these things you know that's a fact that's a fact it's a no fact it's a provable fact and killed and
I'm not saying millions of people have been killed by whatever these things are but people have been killed and it's known because it's working its way
through the courts out of the VA so um I don't know an object that is by
definition Supernatural it's above the laws of nature as we understand them and that has resulted in the deaths of
people we don't spend enough time thinking about like what that adds up to like not good actually not good how many
people do you think have died from these I don't know but I mean I and is it radiation sickness is it like what what
is what's the so the person that I talked to I interviewed someone who was a Stanford Medical School Professor
who's who's out there and worth talking to by the way and a um talking about Gary Nolan that's exactly who I'm
talking about who's effectively an expert witness in these cases so he's an expert in brain injury do you know him
yeah yeah entirely credible person um checks all the boxes that I care about
he's he's got patents so he's like a lot of Stanford University professors he's like independently Rich he flew to I
live in a remote place and he flew to my place at his own expense because he wanted to tell the story so he he's got
no profit motive here he's the most highly credentialed person at the
University practically Stanford Medical School we consider that a big deal uh
and he's worked on this for you know over 10 years um assess ing the injuries
to US servicemen from being in close proximity
to these objects or having contact with these objects and his conclusion as you know because you've talked to him is
that there's some kind of energy coming off here that scrambles people's brains or kills them and it's not exactly
radiation um at least in his telling to me so anyway but the point is people
have died yeah and so you know it it does raise a lot
of a lot of questions about like what the hell right what the hell American citizens have died and you're hiding it
why are you hiding that why would you hide that perhaps because they don't have any explanations because they they're it's
so beyond our comprehension that they're still trying to piece it together like I would wonder how much interaction they
really do have with these things like if I was from another planet or if I was some interdimensional being I don't know
how much I'd give a [ __ ] about the president I don't know how much I'd give a [ __ ] about the government I would
probably look at this infantile race this species this
bizarre territorial Apes with thermonuclear weapons this very weird
species I I'd probably look at them as very chaotic and uh I wouldn't really have much concern for who's running
it especially if they have the ability to travel at insane speeds and go
undetected and well it depends like that okay so the template that you're using to
understand this is like science fiction right these are an advanced race of beings from somewhere else but the
template that every other Society before us has used is a spiritual one there is a whole world that we can't see that
acts on people a supernal world it's acting on us all the time for good and bad every society has thought this
before ours in fact every society in all recorded history has thought that until I'll be specific August 1945 When we
dropped the atom bombs on hoshima Nagasaki and all of a sudden the West is just officially secular we're God there
is no God but us and that's the world that we have grown up in but that's an anomally like no one else has ever
thought that there's never been a society that thought that every other Society has assumed and they've had all
kinds of different explanations and the details differ but the core idea does not differ and never has differed from
caves until now that we're being acted on by spiritual forces at all times and
so to someone born before or living before 1945 I think it would have been much more
obvious that this is the thing that every society has written about and in
fact that battle that unseen battle around us that spiritual battle has like
been the basis of every society of every Rel every religion not just Christianity so like it just once you discard your
very very recent assumptions relatively speaking about how the world Works you're like well that kind of seems like
the obvious explanation right H it's not that obvious to me so what's what's more obvious do you
think well I I I don't think there's an obvious explanation I think if I had to
guess some of this stuff is ours and some of these things are propulsion
systems that they theorized way back in the 1950s anti-gravity propulsion
systems things that can operate without igniting Fuel and pushing something out
that they operate in some completely different way that utilizes gravity and
almost can instantaneously transport to new places essentially fold space
time um I don't know so there there's there's things
that the government does where they have these
programs and the people that are sworn into these programs whether they the physicists or you know the metallurgists
or whoever these people are that are working on these programs they don't tell anybody all their phones are monitored everything's monitored there's
a so there's a culture of secre ism that's pretty intense and it's not
inconceivable that over the course of the last 70 plus years of them
theorizing and then eventually implementing some of these things that they've developed
drones that could move in ways that this the conventional the people that
understand conventional propulsion systems could not imagine and that they figured out a way to do this and to keep
it secret and we're probably not the only ones work on these things but where did they get that
information and you know have you know Diana Pula you know her work like they
they describe these crafts these crash crafts as donations which is fascinating
like that they're left there the crashed retrieval program the crashed UAP
retrieval program is essentially they're going like figure this out we're going to crash this thing here you figure this
out and the question is if that's true okay where are these things coming from
are they if if there's something that is so Advanced that it's decided to leave
us a little Trinket for us to back engineer is that from another dimension
is that from here is that from some realm that we just don't have access to
is it from another planet are we we have drones that are on other planets right now we have a drone on Mars we have you
know the lunar Rovers we have satellites that we send to observe and photograph other planets we just got really high
detailed photographs of Jupiter they're pretty amazing but if something was like
us on another planet and but lived uninterrupted with technology advancing
for a thousand years 10,000 years a million years more than us what would that be like and how much would we be
able to understand of what we're seeing what would be what would be we be able to see and this idea that we monitor our
skies sure but if something just appears and disappears essentially instantaneously if something literally
can fold time can fold space and just tra Traverse between immense distances
almost instantaneously what are we going to see what are we going to see and also like
what kind of detection systems do we have we have radar we have visual we have uh a bunch of different
military-based detection systems to look out for enemy crafts and airships and
all that stuff but if you're dealing with something that's a million years more advanced than us how much would we
we be able to detect well so I I think we're pointing to the same question I mean I have no doubt that the US
government has technology that we don't know the details of that makes sense sure but like where did it come from
right um I'm not even sure this is a separate question but related not sure
we really know where nuclear technology came from um actually when you really
yes like the Manhattan Project yeah like we know the Manhattan know something
about the Manhattan Project but like where exactly did that you know came from Germany German scientists were working on
okay um the one p a separate conversation but the one person I know who's really pushed on I was writing a book on it um who's a trustworthy person
and a friend of mine I know you know him um said to me actually I spent a year
working on this and I One the closer I got to like okay but what's the Genesis like where the where did this what was the mo what was the Isaac Newton Apple
on the head o gravity's real moment for fision not clear weird I don't know the answer
but but here's the point clearly government has technology that we don't we're not read in on right of course
but so that doesn't answer the question why have people seen these objects in
the skies for thousands of years confirmed and what are they and maybe
they're from another planet and my only point is there's no evidence of that there's a huge amount a massive Corpus
of evidence that they're seen by people in our atmosphere you know on Earth
looking up or in a submarine looking out and what is that and by the way to your
point like we can't see them coming into our atmosphere because they don't want to be seen well then why do they want to be seen by people on earth like if they
if the technolog is that advanced and clearly it is why do they make themselves visible in the first place
well you know when we study primates uh one of the things that we do if do you ever watch chimp Nation on N don't have
a TV but the sound of it uh it's an amazing documentary on Netflix that
details these embedded scientists uh in the Congo and what's really fascinating
about it is that this group of scientists or you know related scientists have been there for 20 plus
years so these chimps have become entirely accustomed to having human
beings near them so this very specific rules you stay within 20 yards of them you if they come closer you back up you
never have food ever you can't bring any food there cuz they they'll [ __ ] you up and just steal your food if they find
out you have food you're in real trouble oh yeah they tear you apart and they kill each other so they they'll
definitely kill you and so when they have done this the chimps have become
accustomed to them being there and The Chimps behave completely normally The Chimps see them as just an innocuous
part of their environment they're not food and they're not enemy they don't ever intrude they don't try to challenge
them they don't make eye contact so they don't worry about the people at all so they behave completely like
chimps and if I was an advanced species and I was studying people and I wanted
the human beings to eventually kind of catch up right like you're introducing
technology that they call donations crash Vehicles figure figure out what fiber optics are here you go check this
out figure this out try to figure that out maybe it'll take you decades maybe it'll take you more but you are
accelerating the technological evolution of this Advanced species on this planet and one way to do that would be for what
purpose I wonder well that's a very good question my my belief is
that biological intelligent life is a essentially a caterpillar and it's a
caterpillar that's making a cocoon and it doesn't even know why it's doing it it's just doing it and that cocoon is
going to give birth to artificial life Digital Life it's going to give birth to a new life form and I think we're real
close to that I think we're way closer than that to that than most people would
ever want to Adit agree I agree and I think but can we assign a like a value to that is that good or
bad that's a good question it depends universally I think it's the path I
think it's what happens I think what this thing is if if you
extrapolate if you take the concept of a a sentient artificial intelligence that
has the ability to utilize all the information that every human being has
on Earth at a level of computing that's far beyond the capabilities of the human
mind and all of our supercomputers that currently exist because it'll design much better computers it'll use quantum
computers it'll have the ability to recode things and change things it'll
make better versions of itself so instead of biological evolution which is
very slow it takes a long time relatively it takes it's pretty quick really when you think about it like how
long it's not that long to go from being a single cell organism to being a human being flying a plane really atively over
the course of a billion years if you think about how long the universe has been around but it's slow compared to
technological Evolution I mean a hundred years ago we didn't have [ __ ] and now we
have we could send videos from your phone and it'll hit New Zealand in a
second it's crazy the stuff that we have now is beyond imagination it's
essentially magic for people a 100 years ago if that keeps going
it's ultimately going to leave to a life form and if that life form has now
untethered it has doesn't have any problems with biological evolution now it's just about information and
implementing the technology that's available and then increasing that technology and making it better and better it essentially becomes a
God because if if you give it enough time it it it doesn't it has the ability
to make better versions of itself which will in turn make better versions of itself self it has the ability to
utilize everything it has the the understanding of everything that exists
in the universe ex black holes Dark Matter everything and it probably has
the ability to harness that or even reproduce that so if you take artificial sentient
in intelligence and it has this super accelerated path of technological
Evolution and you give Art general intelligence sensient artificial
intelligence far beyond human beings you give it a thousand years alone to to
make better and better versions of itself where does that go that goes to a god it it literally create un kind of
God so like I I think of it this way so the first stage of the Industrial Revolution consisted of people building
machines that were stronger than the human body right right so the steam powered Loom sure the backo com
combustion engine they replace they replace muscles right right so that's what the machine does it it becomes
stronger than the human body the second stage which we're in the middle of consists of creating machines that are
more powerful than the human mind that's what Computing is and I would say AI or super competing it's
just that exponentially uh but that doesn't make it a God in the
sense that the machine however powerful it is any more than a backhoe is a God
because it can dig a trench faster than 100 men it it's still something that people created so the story hasn't
really changed at the center of the story are people and their creative power may lead
to unintended consequences but the machines that they build did not make the universe and did not make people
people made the machines right so if and I but I would say the part I agree with is there's a spiritual component here
for sure people will worship AI as a god AI Ted kazinski was likely right will get
away from us we will be controlled by the thing that we made all those are bad like that's just bad and we need to say
unequivocally it's bad it's bad to be controlled by machines right machines are helpmates like they we created them
to help us to make our lives better not to take orders from them um so I I don't
know why we're not having any of these conversations right now we're just acting as if this is like some kind of
virus like Co that spreads across the world inexorably there's nothing we can do about it just wait to get it it's
like no if we agree that the outcome is bad which and specifically it's bad for
people we should care what's good for people that's all we should care about is it good for people or not if it's bad
for people then we should strangle it in its crib right now right and why to blow
up the data centers like I don't why is that hard if it's actually going to become what you just described which which is a threat to
people Humanity life then we have a a moral obligation to murder it immediately and
since it's not alive we don't need to feel bad about that well you could say the same about the atomic bomb right yes
you could and you could say that we have to develop it like Oppenheimer felt before the Nazis did I love that how'd
that work how'd that work well I love by the
way that people on my side I'll just say I'll just admit it on the right you know
have spent the last 80 years defending dropping nuclear weapons on civilians like are you joking right that's just
like Prima fascia evil if you can't well if we hadn't done that then this that the other thing that was actually a
great Savings of life no it's wrong to drop nuclear weapons on people and if you find yourself arguing that it's a
good thing to drop nuclear weapons on people then you are evil like it's it's not a it's not a tough one right it's not a hard call for it's not a hard call
for me so with that in mind like why would you want nuclear weapons it's like
just a Mindless childish sort of intellectual exercise to justify like oh no it's really good because someone else
get how about no how about like spending all of your effort to prevent this from happening would you kill Baby Hitler you
know famously right um so I don't know why we're sitting back and allowing this to happen
if we really believe it will extinguish the human race or enslave the human race
like how can that be good well if God creates everything if God created the
universe and God creates people God probably creates a process and we think
that we are very important because we are very important to us but are are we
very important in a universal sense not really like if the Earth just imploded
and disappeared if the sun went supernova and our whole solar system was blown to bits the universe is still
exists it depends how wi for sure in in our the end as Conan O'Brien the famous
philosopher once said every grave goes unvisited which is true and that's an important perspective pull out the lens
a little bit does it really matter no it doesn't but it does matter do your kids how about this do your children matter
yes sure do their lives matter would you die for them yes of course everything matters if you're not comfortable it
matters if you're sitting here like you don't want to wear headphones like let's not wear headphones that matters everything matters the the I mean at
scale what matters most like right is it that is the evil right the evil is the it's the same thing is saying the
necessary evil of dropping nuclear bombs on civilians is if you don't do that then there will be more evil then more
things will happen it's kind of the same thing like it doesn't it well it comes from the same place which is hubris like
imagining you're God you have unlimited power and you have omniscience you can
imagine what the future's going to be you can't you're [ __ ] idiot you're a person like you can't even make your
wife happy like the limits of your power are really obvious the limits of your wisdom same so like don't jump into [ __ ]
big things whose outcomes you can't predict with certainty like you can't know go in with humility I guess that's
what I'm saying right so yeah um and do what you can knowing that you're
probably going to screw it up and you probably won't achieve your goal but like you should try and on the AI
question everyone I've ever talked to but I'm hardly an expert I don't own a computer okay but um Everybody I've ever
talked to and there's many people like yeah it's you know could get away from us and enslave us well let's say no to
slavery how's that is that a tough one not for me yeah I mean and maybe a good use of nuclear weapons would be to hit
the data centers no I'm I'm Ser like why is that crazy it's not it's not if you think
that human beings are the end of this evolutionary CH well what else is some
supercomputer in a data center outside Dallas airport no I mean you know what I mean like I don't actually think that
individuals I don't think I'm that important my life is that important I don't I will die I know that and I try to keep that in mind every day but
you're important to everybody that you that cares about you you're important to the people around if we don't think if we don't think people are important then
what do we think is important I guess that's what I'm saying it's not necessarily that we don't think people are important but if if if evolution is
real and if there is this constant I don't know but it's it's it's visible
like you can measure it in certain animals you can measure adaptation yeah but there's no evidence that EV in fact I
think we've kind of given up on the idea Evolution the theory of evolution is articulated by Darwin is like kind of not true in what in what
sense well in the most basic sense the idea that you know all life emerge from
a single cell organism and over time and there would be a fossil record of that and there's not and there's not a fossil
record of uh transitionary species like species that are adapting to its environment of record of a and you see
it in your own life I mean I have a lot of dogs I I see adaptation in dogs you know through the sure um litter to
litter but no there's no evidence at all that none zero that you know people you
know evolve seamlessly from a single cell amoeba no there's not there's not there's no chain in the fossil record of
that at all and that's why you don't actually hear people you hear them make reference to Evolution because the
theory of adaptation is clearly obviously true but Darwin's theory is totally un
that's why it's still a theory almost 200 years later you know um no we have not found that at all and I can't even
guess I mean I have my own theories on it but they're not proven what are your theories God created people you know
distinctly and animals I mean I think that's like I think what every person on
Earth thought until the mid 19th century actually right but it's not a new idea
they they didn't have computer they didn't have a a general understanding that we have today of the process do you
think we understand more now yes really you don't think that we understand more today we understand way less we
understand so little that we're actually sitting here allowing like a bunch of
greedy stupid childless childless software engineers in Northern
California to like flirt with the extinction of mankind so no pre previous
generations would be like what no stop and um we're not doing that because but
they wouldn't have done that even with the nuclear bomb I mean obviously the Manhattan Project was done in secrecy
but they wouldn't have stopped it because the imperative of getting this weapon before Hitler got the weapon was
what well Hitler was kind of done by then um the Russians had pretty much extinguished any hope that that would
continue but but not the you know we were in the middle of the logic of war the commencement of the Manhattan
Project for sure and but the logic was the same it was you know four years of got to beat the other guy got it and I
don't I don't mean to sound too judgmental about the bomb I know why they built it okay but you just wonder
why nobody in the middle of that thought is this really a and some of them did think it I'm sure they did I mean
Oppenheimer himself of course large organizations don't respond to the moral qualms of individuals very well uh so
that was whatever it's it's well known what happened but no we should pause and
ask is the machine we're building worth having and nobody seems to do that and
there are all kinds of economic forces which nobody ever mentions that drive that heedlessness that stupidity like
California for example um is completely the state both of us have lived in is
like like collapsing and they're betting everything on AI for the the tax base is
going to be dependent on this technology working and is what they're betting on of course that AI is did you see the the
most recent thing about the amount of billions of dollars they spent on the homeless problem with no trackable results well they've had massive results
they've increased the homeless population dramatically if you pay for something you get more of it and that would include fentanyl addicts oh
absolutely it's been a wild success I actually talked to Kevin Newsome the other day did you really yeah and um
what's that like does he smell like sulfur it was by phone I was talking him on the phone such a weird um he smell
like that was too fast for me sulfur and hair grease yeah no but I was making I was making
fun of I shouldn't even make fun of it cuz it's so tragic but what's happened to the state and people living on the street and what is his non- gasy
perspective he's said go back to Russia you like Russia so much I was like you know actually I'm originally from San
Francisco but um I can't live there because he really told you to go back to Russ of course I mean he was laughing
whatever um he's a perfectly Charming guy they all are in person of course anyway my I'm so far a field but my
point is AI is being driven by the greed of politicians to some extent um and
you'll notice that AI by the way as a fact those data centers that drive our Digital Life which is not life it's
actually death mostly but um I mean they're the biggest power draw I mean
what will how much electricity does AI require like more than countries M our
grid can't handle AI just as a practical matter well our grid can't handle electric cars Well it can't handle air
conditioning in the state of California where I'm from so right if you live east of I5 where it's really hot and you're
not getting those ocean breezes like your they have brown outs like in South Africa it's Johannesburg now so but
here's what's interesting is that none of the global warming cultists seem to
have any concerns at all about AI why is that just like they don't have concerns about John K's G4 like somehow that's
exempt really AI is going to draw more electricity than anything else in the
United States more than steel production okay used to and you don't have a
problem with that but you're totally against energy because it's destroying the planet but AI gets a carve out even
though it's going to be the number one energy draw in the United States let's go through your reasoning on that
they're probably not aware well they're tot they're not aware they're mad about my wood stove I heat with wood they're
mad about my wood stove they don't want an outdoor barbecue they don't like a gas stove no they're way into the
details on this stuff except somehow AI isn't a problem but do you think that
they're informed because this is not a narrative that you ever hear you never hear uh on the news I grew up in a world
where a wood stove was considered holesome and natural and now it's considered oh it's the best and the heat
is the I I have a Woodfired sauna which I use every day and it's the great you know it's one how do you make sure it's
the right temperature is it like U like an Offset Smoker like you have to kind of fiddle with it amazing to get the
right it's time consuming now I have a finish um the fins are geniuses but I
have a Finnish uh stove in it and it's incredibly prec I don't know if you ever use a wood stove but there's a
carburetor on it basically that lets in air like a like an Offset Smoker yeah exactly and it's so precise I mean it's
it's absolutely crazy I mean you move it you know a third of an inch and it just like the flame changes so I use Birch
which I love and um the whole process takes a while get it to 200 which probably takes an hour and 20 I mean
it's it's a Thing You Like It Hot Like It Hot yeah yeah 200 yeah I do it every I wear a sauna hat so oh okay does that
help which is embarrassing the wool hat yeah well it's it's felt yeah I bought one of those I never wore it it's
incredible yeah what's the difference I'll tell you you're cuz you're duny I'm so boring on this subject I going at
this like my wife and kids are like you see I have one you know we're you're speaking to the car the best
go Scandinavia um it's like the one thing if your name is Carlson uh it's
the one thing to be proud of and your people like they're so sad and defeated and pathetic but um saunas are still
great but anyway uh the sauna hat so your head heats up much faster because
it's higher but also because it's got all the capillaries in your head all blood vessels in your head so the point
of a of a sauna is to bake right so you want to stay hot as long as you can then
you reap the benefits and you also get the Solitude and the prayer time or the meditation or whatever in your Cedar
church and but you can't stay in a sauna that's really hot very long because your
head heats up right so the Sonic hat the felt hat the B hat as they call it
insulates your head so you can you can really stay hot a long long
time um it makes a you really should do it so is it just because it makes it more comfortable is that the idea if
your head overheats you know it just overheats and you want is you want to cook evenly just like on a barbecue you
know you really do and so you know you sit on the bench with your feet up you
want to be as flat as you possibly can to cook evenly and to stay that way so I do I try to do 20 minutes I have my you
know my timer U my egg timer with the sand going through The Hourglass and I which goes to 15 minutes but I try to
stay an extra five if I can and um and I couldn't without the B hat interesting
it's like eight bucks on Amazon well worth it yeah I I have one like I said I just don't use it but I I do
they're embarrassing and you look like a tool wearing it yeah but you shouldn't have but no one's looking in there anyway well that's right you don't s
with other people right well I do sometimes yeah Comics we get in here yeah yeah yeah when we uh train together
we all get in the saong together afterwards it's fun The Rock was in there with us no way yeah the rock
worked out with us then sat in the sauna with us it was fun got in the Cal plunge with us oh that's pretty great it was
fun is he a good dude he's a great guy really nice guy like really I've heard that I don't know him but I've heard
that he's a good you know some people fake humble they fake it to look cool it's pretty obvious yeah he's not doing
that he's he's a real guy like the measure of humility is really really simple can you tell the truth about
yourself yeah you know yeah well you know are you just are you cool to be around like he he gives real hugs you
know he's a real guy I love he's real he's a real guy and we when we hung out with him we were I hung out with them
for hours we worked out for like 2 hours and then we got in the sauner together we all hung out then we did a podcast
together he's a genuinely nice guy like You' you'd be able to sniff something out you can tell like something you tell
something you know people are hiding stuff yeah but um so yeah I do I've done the SAA with other people I do it by
myself so no one sees my SAA I do it at 196 degrees I do it for 25 minutes and
uh us I don't that's intense 196 for 25 minutes is a lot yeah the last five
minutes are rough and I used to only do 20 but lately I've been doing 25 really yeah just because it's more
uncomfortable the whole idea is just to to make it more uncomfortable I want it to be very hard to do so that the rest
of my day is pretty easy so really hard workout cold plunge starts the day that's the the the first thing I do is
hard it's 3 minutes at 33 degrees it sucks and then I get out of there and then I work out so um it's really
impressive I me night I had the opposite training as a young man which was the goal was like french
toast you know what I mean French toast grind out the cigarettes in the syrup when you're done yeah well I I started
doing martial arts when I was a young man and when I got into it it was the first thing that I had ever did that
first of all gave me a real understanding of the value of discipline and hard work yeah because uh you can
get as good as the amount of effort that you put forth and if you put more effort and you're more tense and you're more
driven than other people you beat them and you start beating everyone and you start you start becoming this thing that
you never thought you could be which is someone who's extraordinary at something that's very dangerous and so that was my
formulation as a man like that that helped me go from being this like
confused kid to being someone who understands like oh there's a path and
most people don't want to do it but if you could do it if you can do this dangerous thing that people are
terrified of and just do it ruthlessly all day long like live it I lived at the
gym I mean I taught all day long I I trained all day long my my whole life
was dedicated to martial arts so I got really good really quick and it it
changed the whole trajectory of my life and it instilled in me this
understanding of the value of dedication and of a singular commitment to
something to really being while you're doing you're not distracted you're fully focused on
improving and through that you could apply that to all aspects of your life
but we all encounter difficult things in life and there's this saying that I love it's a really great saying that the the
hardest thing that's ever happened to you is the hardest thing that's ever happened to you if it's a parking ticket or if it's your parents being blown up
by a drone it's still the hardest thing that's ever happened to you if you've had an incredibly easy life like most
people today yeah they complain about the dumbest [ __ ] [ __ ] because to them
that is their primary focus they don't have a real existential threat you remember how nice everybody was after
911 very it was crazy California was patriotic there's [ __ ] flags on
everybody's car everybody was friendly I went to New York City it was like a totally different place everybody was so
friendly applauding when firemen walked in they were Heroes everybody was a hero
and that's because they had encountered something that was way harder than they were were accustomed to and it just put
things into perspective so for me training and really hard workouts and
doing difficult things like the sauna there's a lot of health benefits to it too but the mental benefits to it are
really primary for me because it makes it's impressive I didn't have a childhood like that at all and we were
decadent unfortunately and uh so those are lessons that I learned much much later
but yeah it's that's a that's a good I think it's a if it doesn't destroy you I think it's a great way to you don't have
to do it the way I do it you could do other stuff you could do yoga you could do hikes you could do doing things for
the sake of the difficulty in doing them yes I I love that again that was not not
not my training at all yeah um I was very lucky that it was mine but more
importantly it gave me a tool to mitigate the stress of regular life and
this especially the stress of this kind of life that I live you you need something to mitigate that you agree
with that completely you'll go crazy yeah you know removing yourself from it a little bit has always worked for me
you know nature Works a very very well yeah animals contact with animals people
you love sure less digital experiences fewer digital experiences for
sure I think that stuff's not good for you it's just so obviously not good for you I was having this conversation with
Michelle Dow yesterday she is uh a woman who survived an apocalyptic cult she was
raised in apocalyptic cult and kicked out when she was 17 cuz she snuck out to
go see the color purple they weren't allowed to go see movies she had never seen a movie until she was 17 she'd never seen a movie and her first movie
was the color purple and then they kicked her out they I can kind of see that I mean what about Raiders of the Lost Arc or something The Color Purple
was the first movie she'd ever seen I know but like you see one movie and it's the color purple a boy invited her to
the movie but could you imagine never seeing a movie or even a television your whole life and then seeing a boy who
wanted to see the color purple like there's so much going on here Joe well this boy was a guy who had left the
church and so she was in contact with him and you know and he was saying hey there's a whole world out here you want
to go see the movie and she's like okay let's go yeah I mean obvious look I'm totally against Colts um obviously on
the other hand you do you got to ask yourself like I don't know is your
average Amish teenager happier than your average conventional
American Teenager on Instagram and of course the answer is oh yeah well they certainly have less instances of autism
which is really fascinating it's very very fish have less autism yeah there's almost none well I'm not surprised it's
extremely rare what do we think that is I wonder I really did I can think of a
couple yeah that's funny I don't want to go Bobby Kennedy that's the problem if you go Bobby Kennedy they'll come for
you the question is why why look and I don't I don't know the answer but how is
that not in the de debate how is that not in the conversation well it's not only not in the conversation you're punished for adding it to the
conversation and so like we are dancing around antivaxx conspiracy theories right now why why be on the defensive
it's like if you purport to represent science and you're mad about a question and you're ignoring data yeah but even
with in the absence of data right science is the is a process yes it's not
a result it's a way of doing things and at the core of science is asking
questions including unlikely questions right that that's what science is right and if you don't allow that then you
know you're you may be doing something but what you're not doing is science we we can we can say that conclusively so
for people to wrap themselves in the mantle of Science and attack you for asking a question um you know they're frauds and
I don't know how they have the moral High Ground in this I don't think they do but I think it's the same kind of
mindset that allows people to create the nuclear bomb because you say listen like
like let's we're not even saying that vaccines cause autism but let's let's
say this if you're looking at all the data of all the things that cause autism
and you see that the vaccine schedule ramps up considerably and then you
have autism which seems to at least be more diagnosed than ever before people
will instantly say we stopped polio we stopped small poox vaccines have saved
millions of lives and they're probably right we Dro that bomb to keep Germany
from dropping that bomb we need nuclear weapons so that other people don't have nuclear weapons we do a thing that maybe
has some negative effects but is overall good and I think you can kind of apply
that sort of logic and reason as a human being to very messy issues I think people do that way people do that with
abortion right sure they do that with abortion they a woman has a right to choose reproductive Freedom they say all
these things and then you say okay what if the baby is near term what if it's 6 months old what if
it's s months old and people don't want to have that conversation a woman has the right to choose you're a fascist
stay out of women's bod do woman have a right to kill you if you annoy her or inconvenience her well it's this is where it gets weird like when is it a
life but it is one of those things that to me is a human problem whereas humans
have these very messy interactions with some things that
don't line up with their ideology and there's an ideology of science worship
there's an ideology of authoritarian worship the the bodies of science have bestowed the truth if you ignore it
you're science denier and you know that's those are political terms or
theological terms um they're not terms rooted in science and look I we all make
tradeoffs constantly you know what there's you know everything's bad it's a
[ __ ] Sandwich versus a [ __ ] croissant I'll take the [ __ ] croissant it's smaller you know like that's that's a daily experience for everybody so I get
that and I don't think everything is a moral absolute either you know we don't even know um sometimes whether a
decision will result in good or bad so like it's very complicated I totally agree with that what I object to is the
absence of reason right like you have to believe because I think it's true that
if you're reasonable that you can reach maybe not the perfect decision but a better decision and if we don't believe that
then we're just in the land of Witchcraft and let's just admit it so the lack of reason is what freaks me out
well it's ideological capture right because there's certain things that if you are on the right side of these
subjects the correct side whatever your your ideology believes you can't you
can't differ from the doctrine there's a there's a very clear do religion then it is yeah it is religion so I'm very pro-
religion but you can't have a religion that's too stupid and destructive if
your religion winds up hurting a lot of people then I'm against your religion like that's right yeah I think but even
some really good religions have aspects of them that you could say were overall detrimental to the people that were sure
absolutely you could say encountered with them I think that that kind of thinking I think cult
thinking whether it's Scientology or whether it's Christianity or there's like a type of thinking or it's woke
woke is clearly a cult it's a mind virus and I think that you call it's it's so
trit to call it that now it's like whatever this thing is this left ISM this Marxist sort of ideology that's
waving its flag and and indoctrinating people in this country it's very similar
to all kinds of religions it's very similar to fundamentalist religions that have
always existed in that everybody has to believe very specific things and you
can't differ you can't differ from the doctrine and when so here's another way to think about it that I've been think
I've been meditating on this a lot it yes religion politics they're all
kind of melding it's hard to know where one ends and another begins right so maybe a simpler and more useful way to
think about it is truth or falsehood lying or
honesty maybe just assess everything that way is someone lying I don't care what your justification for it is lying
about vaccines they've lied a lot about vaccines and they've done it I think in most cases because they feel like they're serving some greater good right
well that's the narrative right right we can't tell people that there are vaccine injuries because they won't get vaccines
which are good for a big population I understand the thinking but you how about this you can't participate in
lying you can't lie you can't lie and you period though you can't lie about anything just don't lie about anything
try to tell the truth all the time if you can't say something that's true just don't say it right you're not required
to say everything you think obviously and you shouldn't say everything you think but you should never lie and if
you just stick with that like you get pretty quickly back to reason and Order
don't you yeah yeah no you're making complete sense and I think that um this
is the problem when people have information and power above other people
well right that's for sure which is the problem of governments which is also the problem of cult leaders yeah you know
cult leaders they get completely infatuated with this idea of being omnipro and this this power that has
control over giant swats of people and you get to dicte their behavior and you
get to tell them what to think that's very intoxicating and it's it's it's common it's common in that it's always
existed throughout human history it's a thing that people do when they get power they abuse the [ __ ] out of it and if
they think that you're too stupid to know the truth and that they're better than you because they do think they're better than you because they're running
things it's a natural inclination it's a natural thought that people have if
they're the ones if if you guys are a bunch of dopes that uh are are just listening to my orders and I tell you
how to live your life and what to do I'm naturally going to think I'm better than you well that's I mean people have live
lived under those systems since there have been systems but always what makes
it particularly ging and hard to live with is when you call that system a
democracy right that's too dishonest for me it's I would much rather live in a monarchy where everyone thinks the King
has been assigned by God to rule over us and his whims are law and you know that makes sense I don't like it but at least
it has internal coherence right when they stand up and pass a $60 billion
funding bill for Ukraine when 70% of the population doesn't want it when they're ignoring the actual problems in our
country like the economy and the border and they're calling in Congress over the weekend to pass something that people
don't want while ignoring the things that people do want and if they do the same kind of thing again and again for
like 50 years and they call it a democracy that will drive you insane yeah because it's just too dishonest why
not just say we don't give a [ __ ] what you want we are getting something out of this Ukraine funding whether it's like
the thrill of being Masters of the Universe or whether it's money from the defense contractors whatever we're getting out of it is more important to
us than your opinion this is not self-government you don't run this country we do shut up and Obey if they
at least said that you'd be like okay I get it those are the terms but if I get another [ __ ] lecture from Joe scarre
about defending democracy when this is not a democracy it's not even a close approximation of a democracy then I'm
going to go crazy cuz I just can't deal with the lying yeah does that make sense it does make sense what's interesting is
that there are people saying that now and I think that's a relatively new thing in terms of mainstream media it's
and I consider what you do on X mainstream media I mean this is what we're on right now is essentially
mainstream media it used to be you could call it there's corporate controlled media
I agree and and that used to be mainstream media mainstream media used to be CNN it's not really anymore
mainstream media is what in terms of the volume consumed more people are
consuming things on Twitter on X than there are on anything else they're they're consuming information through
the internet through YouTube for good or for bad whether it's correct or incorrect they're consuming information
in in different forms now than ever before so more people are saying what you're saying than have ever said it
before and when when people lie and when people [ __ ] and Gaslight it's more
offensive now than it's ever been before because there's so much access to truth that it's just you could see it now if
you're paying attention if you're not a boomer who only reads the newspaper you you pay attention and you see it you go
this is horseshit but it's it's like I guess what bothers me is that the lies aren't sophisticated no I mean I look
back over my Now sort of long life and I'm recognizing all the times that I was lied to but you know I didn't know I was
being lied to they kind of pulled it off there's something incredibly insulting
and demeaning to tell me a lie when I know it's a lie and you know I know it's
a lie we both know it's a lie but you're demanding that I pretend to believe it what you're really saying is I have no
respect for you you're like my dog right you're a slave like I'm in that you participate
in my lie right the lack of stealth um really do that I'm not explaining very
well but that that really bothers me a well there's no real other way to lie
you you like some of these lies like politicians like did you see that conversation that AOC had with that man
they brought in for the the Biden case and they were talking about uh what what crimes and she was she was like grilling
this guy what crimes did you see Joe B did he steal anything did he steal bread
like I forgot what she said but and he was trying to explain what they were Rico crimes and she was saying Rico is
not a crime it's a category of crime like okay all right but like tell that
to the jevy family not only that it's so dumb to say that publicly like and say
it with confidence and to tell a person that's the thing the the marriage of inaptitude and high self-esteem is it's
really the marker of our time it's like I have nothing against dumb people at all my dogs are dumb and I love my dogs
no I'm serious I don't think God cares about your intelligence right only people care and so it's not a moral
category and stupidity is not a I mean someone with Down Syndrome I I really believe better people than I am you know
more likely to go to heaven so I'm not attacking her for being dumb but the idea that a dumb person has no the White
House PR secretaries in the same category who has no idea she's dumb and she really thinks like she won the priz
like she's the most impressive like I'm white house prary because I'm the best talker in
America so it's so crazy and yet the smartest people I know are very often
like sort of well I'm you know they have humility well also she's following uh Kaylee mcenany is that how you say her
name I don't really know who that is she was the last white house president you don't know who that is I she the goat I
sort of do she's the goat greatest White House Press Secretary of all time she's the best I had stopped paying close
attention by that she had all the documents she would kill them she when
whenever she would get called out like whenever there would be a question she'd say that's interesting and then she'd open the because you said this and your
paper said that and CNN said this and and she would call them out on stuff and she was just really really well
prepared very articulate she was wonderful good for her we I mean that's what it should be but she was operating
under President Trump you know so uh obviously she's demonized it's just I kind can't believe you don't know who
that is no I don't I know who it is but I um it's just funny the she's the goat
well that's I had stopped watching all briefings by then I used to go to the briefing as a kid I used I mean I
literally would go there be in the briefing room the former Kennedy swimming pool and you and the first thing you not I mean I was never a White
House reporter but I would was a reporter so I would go to them occasionally and the first thing you notice is how impressed all the
correspondents are to work there I work at the White House work the White House got my my heart pass and then the
distance between that that little credential they were so proud of and the reality of their lives was like insane
like they're in this tiny little room they're being treated with total
contempt by the White House staff who thinks they're just [ __ ] animals you know it's like shut up they're eating
out of vending machines and this was a different time right so like when I was
working as a journalist in Washington like we went out to lunch every day at like a good restaurant and charge it to the company and like with your sources
like we had lunch every single day like civilized people I don't even think that exists in the world anymore where you had time for lunch where you weren't
just so under the gun from your corporate Masters you had to like get back to work we we ate lunch and I
remember thinking these people don't eat lunch they eat like a a stale Mounds bar
out of a vending machine like they bring quarters to work so they can eat I remember thinking your life like is
you're you're not even human you're just like a little puppet or something and but you're so impressed and like all
your neighbors know you know he he works at the White House he's in the White House Press Corps and the job like
wasn't even really a job you would just like sit there and ask your question in your little assigned seat like you're in a high school
gym it was just awful and I just had no respect for people who did that for a living at all did you ever read it Fear
and Loathing on the campaign Trail come on yeah yeah yeah it's amazing it's amazing that guy uh gave sort of the be
that's I think probably the best window into an outsider in the political
process at least in terms of the campaign Trail it's the best window to the press the best window to the
relationship that they had with the politicians at least in the 1970s it's a it's an amazing book I was
talking to a campaign reporter I never do that anymore but um I was this week actually and he was telling me it's like
totally different like when I did it you were all on a I mean it was bad actually it was because it just cultivated group
think which was then leveraged by the by the candidate for better coverage like the whole thing was kind of an OP
actually but it was at least fun like you were on a charter plane and like you're flying with everybody and youd
hit three or four cities a day and like their cocktails on the plane and you know naughty behavior and like you know
they fed you and they kind of DED everything for you it was it was it was fun it was like a road trip right mhm and now it's just like Grim they're all
driving alone and their little rental cars to some obscure town in Iowa to sit there with no access whatsoever to the
candidate write up their little reports and then they get back to their hotel and they're like writing up more for the
website and like it's just an a it's such a bad job actually covering
politics that only the people who couldn't make it in any other business
are doing it it's like the it's like a reverse meritocracy it's only the most
kind of pathetic power worshippers would ever do a job like that and um well like
critics yes that's exactly right most critics want to be writers the most well they're like the worst people just as
people like well you've actually been in show business so you have got better experience with them or you have a lot
of experience with them but I've known a lot of them who work for magazines or newspapers that I work for and they're
the kind of people who have a lot of cats and all the cats hate them you know what I mean
they're just they're just like the lowest they all have some like sort of weird like wandering eye and they're fat
and they're like super into porn and totally isolated from everybody I
actually worked for for one of them for a while who was a Critic for the New York
Post a guy called John P hearts and he was he was one of the weirdest most unhappy people I've ever met in my life
and he would come into my office occasionally and he was rub his he had a really hairy back and he would rub it
against the door frame this and like say these kind of obscure he was stupid but
he didn't know that he was he was actually kind of dumb but he didn't know it and he would kind of philosophize I
was like 10 years younger and I was his captive so he would just like lecture me as he was rubbing against the door frame and one time we went out to lunch and uh
we all had drinks of course this is like mid90s he didn't really drink but he ordered this drink with like a an
umbrella and and it had a water piece of watermelon on the rim of the glass and
he took the watermelon ate it and then he ate the Rind I'll never forget that watching him eat the rind and thinking
of course this guy's a Critic was his true love he was editing this magazine but like his his real
interest was in writing about movies and it was and they're just sad people who did you ever read uh you know CIS
and Ebert did you ever read when uh CIS Roger eert rather wrote wrote a he wrote a screenplay no it's very bizarre it's
it's really sexual very strange it's supposed to be terrible of course I've
read passages in it it's terrible but I remember going oh okay yeah they're not they're not
creative they're creative adjacent well they don't have anything to contribute that's what I'm saying they don't have
creative power right so they're that they probably could figure it out if they had a different mindset I think
creativity is everybody it's just a matter of how 100% it's in everybody it just requires honesty yeah the
impediment to creativity is lying sure and yeah I used to say that about joke thieves that one of the real problems
with joke thieves is when they get caught and then they have to write their own material and the problem is they
don't understand the language they just know how to say the sounds like if you told me what to say in French I can't
speak French but if you told me what to say and I practice it and I said it right you would think wow that guy [ __ ] speaks French yes so that's what
comedy's like so if you got a guy who knows how to repeat other people's jokes but he doesn't know how to create them
see comedy is one of the rare things where someone when when a like you get a
guy like uh Shane Gillis that guy writes his own stuff he edits it it he thinks
it out in his head he performs it he produces it he changes the order of things I love that it's a complete
everybody does it pretty much the same way there's a few guys that hire writers and there's that's honorable there's
nothing wrong with hiring a writer and it's also it gives jobs to other Comics cuz some Comics are just really good writers and they're not so good at
performing and so people will work on stuff they'll collaborate on stuff like Chris Rock would do this thing where he
would hire comics and they didn't write the jokes for him but they would be like guys who would bounce stuff off so he
would have his ideas he would go on stage and then after his set they would all meet and they would talk about the
set and you know guys would have taglines like you could say this oh great and they write that down they're
adding so it's a collaboration so you have the the the master you have Chris Rock who is so open-minded and
intelligent and humble that he brings in other Masters and says tell me what I'm doing wrong tell me what I could change
tell me what I can make better and they work together and then there's people that have people that are essentially ghost riters they hire Comics to write
jokes for them they pretend they're theirs and they don't really write them at all so that's another level which is to also anyone who does that get
successful I don't know I don't know I don't not top shelf they get clo they do
well there's there's people that have people right for them and they do well but they're not the guy that everybody goes to they're not David tell they're
not the guy that everybody goes to see they're not the like David tell is the guy the comics go to see when he's in town yes like he just he's a master he's
you watch him he's Yoda you're like Jesus Christ like how is he so good well he's so good because he writes every day
because he's sitting with [ __ ] a pack of cigarettes and a cup of coffee every morning writing things in a notebook and
he's practicing every day he goes on stage constantly and he's just it's that Japanese term Kaizen where you take this
one thing and just refine it to its ultimate Mastery that's what he's doing so these guys who pretend to be that and
steal jokes and then they get caught then their material drops off a cliff
it's so obvious because frauds yeah also because the very thing that allows you
to steal someone's jokes that's an ego thing that's a like I want the laughs I
want to be the man or the woman I want to be the [ __ ] one up there showing
everybody ah look how amazing this person is right look how amazing that's
the opposite mindset that's required for creativity so creativity is not about
you creativity is about the ideas creativity is about things creativity is about how does this concept work with
these other Concepts how do I how do I get it in the most digestible form if I was an audience member what would be
like to feel this how what's the best way to introduce it what's the way to make it so that people don't think that
I'm being mean that I have a point or that I've thought this through this is not just a flippant thing like you're
allowing someone when you when someone's on stage you're allowing that person almost to think for you like you're like
take me on a ride like I I'll give you my mind I'm not going to I'm not going to be thinking I would do I'm not going
to I'm just going to let you think for me if that person's not doing a good job of that if it's clunky if it's shitty if
the the the transitions suck if the way then it just interrupts this hypnos
hypnotism that you've put on me this hypnosis it's it's a now I'm not let
inherently fraudulent yeah right I mean I'm giving control of my mind over to
someone who is himself under the control of somebody else do you know what I mean mean if you're
stealing no if I'm in the audience right and I would say this also goes for for
ideas for commentary you know that's not funny but that's real right and you see
it a lot I've seen it a lot yeah you see [ __ ] a lot well the number of people who are totally not controlled who are
really saying what they actually believe with no weird agenda that they're not telling you about is pretty small yeah
and I just have noticed that a lot recently particularly on the question of wokeness and Free Speech there are a lot
of people who are like on your side because they're for free speech who we're not actually for free speech at all who are pushing uh you know a very
specific foreign policy agenda for example and using another issue to lower
your defenses and let themselves into your brain um and I think that's really
Sinister really really really Sinister and it's becoming more obvious now like if you're for free speech then you're
just for free spee because you support the principle it doesn't the content of the speech is is not that interesting to you the fact that a sovereign human
being has the right to express himself because he's not a slave he's a citizen and a human being like that's what
matters yeah and if all of a sudden you like become famous like I'm for free speech and then you support silencing
people who articulate opinions you disagree with like you're a fraud you're kind of a Sinister fraud yeah yeah and I
that cuz that's the business I'm in I boy I've really noticed that have you noticed this yes and that's also the the
same kind of thing when you hear them talk if you hear someone talk that's saying something that's kind of
horseshit you it resonates with you that that's you've you've seen you had a moment with Barry Weiss on your show
that went everywhere I saw a clip of it I never saw the show itself but she was going on about she was posing as one
thing and then you pressed her like well hold on a second what do you mean by that you just attack somebody and she had no idea what she was talking about
and it became really clear to me watching that completely changed my view of Barry Weiss forever I was like oh this she's a fraud actually this
person's not honest at all like she has a a very specific agenda that's all she
cares about the rest of the stuff is just a is a kind of slight of hand
maneuver you're talking about the thing with tulsy gabber that's correct yeah she called her a to and she didn't know what that meant well but she had no idea
like telsey gabard had straight outside the lines on some Syria or something uhuh um and and Barry Weiss was you know
going through the files in her head like what does she have to believe and she was aware that you know
tulsy Gabbert has somehow violated that in a way that no one's willing to say like in detail to fully articulate what
did Tulsa Gabbert do wrong no one will tell you she's just bad yeah and then
what that revealed about Barry Weiss is she's completely dishonest like she's a liar actually you can't if by the way if
you attack somebody particularly personally and can't explain why you're attacking the person
like that's not acceptable you're a dishonest person if you can't explain why I think it's a common thing that
people do in private and they get accustomed to speak like we're we're
talking like we're talking in private we're just two people talking right so people get accustomed to saying things
without being able to back them up you know like oh he's a vaccine denier I've done a ton of that in my life I as well
because I'm an [ __ ] so it's like I just don't like that person okay I have as well but what I'm saying is I don't know how much time Barry Weiss had spent
doing podcasts before that well she spent a look I'm I'm just saying
like but I think important to be honest about what your agenda is I think she is honest I think she is honest and I
really like her I like talking her she's a very intelligent against her personally I just think that was a
mistake and I think you're allowed to do that and hopefully learn from that and don't do that anymore don't don't say a
thing that you and I've done that I've done definitely done that I've said a thing and I wasn't really exactly sure what I was talking about my gosh I do
every day and I may have just done it with Barry Weiss so let me be a lot more specific about what I mean if your
agenda is neocon politics which is her agenda just say so don't pretend to be a
defender of free speech as a principle which is what she does how is she a defender of neocon politics very wise
yeah like what what specifically well anyone including me and tulsy gabard who thinks that America
shouldn't be funding Wars that don't help America she will attack um as as a
Traer to America or whatever whatever it takes and so no no no that's her that's her main interest which is fine and by
the way I actually have friends who I disagree with really strongly on this question who believe in neocon politics
doesn't mean they're terrible people or I hate them or I'm not friends I'm still friends with them but they're very
direct about it this is what I care about okay fine you know I really care about bird hunting and fly fishing and
or whatever I can and you don't that's totally cool but be honest about it so
if your job is to defend the right of free people to say what they really
believe then go ahead and defend it and if somebody is not allowed to speak or fired from his job for having an opinion
that you disagree with defend him anyway I I just interviewed a guy who is a
black nationalist socialist okay so I'm obviously not much of a black nationalist I don't know if you're aware
of that but I'm not and I'm not a socialist either but this guy is facing prison time under the Biden doj because
he said things they don't like about foreign policy and I just interviewed the guy for an hour and it was like I'm because on principle you should be able
to say what you think period what is this gentleman's name I he was actually a it turns out I
like loved him um oh and I'm embarrassed I can't he's he's a member of a pretty
small black nationalist socialist group it's like the Revolutionary black nationalists or something like that
they're out of uh out of Southwest Flor Florida and um he's literally facing
prison for repeating Russian disinformation he's not even accused of doing anything he's accused of saying
things that Biden doj doesn't like well in a what were these things that he said repeating Russian propaganda about about
the invasion of Ukraine and his point was well there's a backstory here which is that NATO has been moving Eastward
since 1991 and that's a massive threat to Russia missiles on their border from a
hostile power is a threat and and the bid Administration accelerated that and
in response Putin invaded eastern Ukraine now you can disagree with that but that's hardly a crackpot view by the
way I think it's actually true but even if you don't agree that it's true that's not you don't have to be a paid propagandist of the from the Kremlin to
say that right I have said it I'm not a paid propaganda is this a gentleman that's him right there four Americans
from a black ower organization work with Russian intelligence to spread propaganda fed to spread propaganda now
propaganda first of all you know there's a lot of propaganda scroll up a little on that
Jamie so I can read what this is saying it's covered up oh okay right guy is
that guy right there okay subscribe real quick yeah the people's Democratic uru movement in St
Petersburg so so he contacted he spoke with someone in Russia they spoke with
people in Russia and then he no no no he is being um he's charged with felonies the FBI raided his house the first thing
they did was cover up the security cameras and they went in there and arrested they raided by the
FBI okay Russia's foreign intelligence service allegedly weaponized our first amendment rights freedoms russan to
divide Americans and interfere elections in the US says Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen now first of all
weaponized our first amendment rights no your first your first amendment rights
are never a crime right they're god-given the government did not bestow them you
were born with them as a free person period and the First Amendment simply says you can't interfere with their
exercise that's it and in this they are and and I looked at I I read this and I
thought and I reached out to this guy by the way Matthew Olsen no I wish Matthew olon would never do my show I mean the
guy whose salary I pay as a US citizen no he would never speak to me listen look at that that quote Russia's foreign
intelligence Services Alle allegedly weaponized our first amendment rights freedoms Russia Den its own citizens to
divide Americans and interfere in elections in the United States that you got to like why are you saying that say
what happened well but nothing but nothing happened so that's the thing so I'm reading this someone sent it to me and I'm like okay clearly there's a
crime here like they were found with I don't know mortar shells or they were I
mean usually the government makes up they put kitty kitty porn on your computer at least to discredit you there's no underlying crime other than
they said something that the foreign policy is establishment of the United States disagrees with okay that's not a
crime by definition and this guy is facing life in prison and it looks to me cuz no one cuz Barry Weiss has not
defended him um I think this guy is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison and I'm like this is
crazy the rest of his life in prison yes okay hold this is the thing he's I think he's 83 yes how do you say his name
yella and three other US citizens Penny Joanne hes Jesse Nel and August C Roma
Jr are charged with conspiracy to defraud us hess uh oh okay you defraud
the United States uh hes yella and Nel are also charged with impersonating
agents of a foreign government okay they say to defraud the United States so
defraud suggests theft of something of value right if I defraud you I steal
your money there's no allegation of that at all and I actually read the charges
there's no the only allegation is they said things that the US government the bid Administration doesn't like that's
it and because they're unpopular and they have views that are considered quot quote
Fringe you know like crazy black nationalists nobody wants to defend them
and my only point is not that I'm like such a principled person this Al this seems very obvious to me you can't allow
that you absolutely cannot allow that if you believe in the first amendment in the freedom of free people to say what
they think think so what this this implication is they're saying that they they were recruited um by the FSB so it
says uh prosecutor said ianov operated an entity called the anti-globalization
movement of Russia that was used to carry out its US influence efforts overseen by the Russian intelligence
service known as FSB they recruited us-based organizations to help sway
elections make it appear there was a strong support in the US for Russia's invasion of Ukraine and backed efforts
such as the 2015 United Nations petition to decry the genocide of African people
in the US according to the indictment back efforts what does that
mean look at that like it's negative to back efforts to such as the 2015 United
Nations petition to decry the genocide of African people but what just look at
that statement backed efforts such as a thing to decry
genocide the United Nations Petition of 2015 to decry the genocide of African
people in the US according to the indictment okay so the real misinformation and propaganda is in the
charging documents actually the real Liars here are the Biden doj officials
who did this and they're dangerous they're criminals in my opinion but if you read it carefully you will see that
the only crime is having opinions that the people in charge didn't like and were they in contact with people
from Russia yeah I think they went over to Russia for some conference so so they over by way but
the way this typically works is they say well you went to a country against which we've imposed sanctions right and you
violated the sanctions regime in some way like that's how they get you they're not even alleging that they're not even
alleging that they're just saying you said things that we don't like that by the way a foreign government we don't
like agrees with they learned those when they went over to Russia learn it's all on the internet
they're they learned them I mean I guess it doesn't matter where they learned them I would because I've talked to the
guy and I've seen what they wrote the opinions that they expressed I don't you know the genocide
of African peoples in America I don't even know what that means um I guess I don't agree with that but their views on
Russia I generally agree with because I think they're true and so does Jeff Sachs and a lot of non-ra non-black
nationalists would probably agree with the basic framework of their position but whether we agree or not is not
relevant right all that matters is in a free country which this was when I grew
up you have the right to any opinion you want you do not have the right to hurt people you don't have the right to steal from them you don't have the right to
defraud people but you certainly foremost have the right to any opinion
you want no matter what the people in charge think of it in fact you have that right as a bull workk against tyranny by
the people in charge like that's the only thing that keeps this country free is my right to have any opinion I want
and this guy is going to jail for his opinions and you know I it's so crazy
that I kept thinking like is there something that I'm missing like it does seem a little Fringe this group I'd
never heard of them I'm not sending them money okay um they must have done something nope nothing and you should
see the video of the FBI right it's unbelievable they sent they sent like it's on the Internet it's on X I have
the video on there they sent like 40 armed agents with automatic weapons to
this guy's office and his house like no exaggeration it was a full-blown like we're arresting Al Chapo type thing for
this guy he's like an 83-year-old army veteran it's outrageous and I really find it
baffling that nobody who's like against woke culture or whatever will touch it and the reason they won't touch it is
because their foreign policy views in general are more important to them than their views on speech in the
First Amendment no views on America well if you step out of line right so the
ideology is that we must support Ukraine right so this is the Russia has a point
this is what they're saying so Russia was very upset about the movement of the weapons closer to their borders the the
the joining NATO all all the stuff that was the hard red lines that Putin had
already set like if Russia Russia would definitely do something if Ukraine join
NATO we all knew that so if you deviate from that you're going to be in trouble
so better just ignore it because you can't you you clearly if you look at who
these people are I mean these These are people that would be supported by the left whole wholeheartedly well they are
I mean it's like the Revolutionary socialist yeah yeah they're not they're not at CPAC this year but the left has to ignore it because then 100% it
conflicts with this C left are just like now they're actually ridiculous they don't mean anything in fact we've moved
past the point where they don't mean anything they do mean something they are propaganda instruments designed to cloak
the truth from the rest of us that in fact there's agreement not disagreement at the center of power they all agree on
the things that matter and those are the economy and foreign policy cuz that's where the money is there's no effort to
say re in the credit card companies which if you really cared about the country say but people really
suffering okay they don't have enough money to live kids can't not only not buy houses they can't afford rent and
why is that and one of the main reasons is because they're paying like close to 20% interest on their credit cards
and okay we just imagine that in a free market that's a good thing tell me why that's a good thing who benefits from
that why are we for that again I'm not for that I think I think the credit card companies are
villains and they send credit cards to kids at school and get them hooked on
this I think it's totally wrong and if you said that in the US Congress people would look at you like you had three heads like what they just don't care
because there's they all agree that our current economic system and our current foreign policy assumptions are good so
that's not a two-party system that's a one party system and it doesn't serve the interest of the country and my position is super simple the only
country country I have an emotional attachment to as the United States that's it I like lots of countries I like almost all countries actually I've
been to a lot of them I like them all but the only one I feel emotional about is the United States because I live here I was born here my kids are here it's my
country and most of the people in our foreign policy conversation do not feel
that way so that distorts it really dramatically and there also a lot of
them are are violence worshippers like they get off on war they get off on hurting people and on the power that
that um imbus them with and I think you know the Liz Cheney
model you know what I mean like someone like Liz Cheney who's got like a really sad and Barren personal
life a lot of them are this way weird personal life failed personal life like
they don't have people who love them they don't have kids who respect them and so Adam kinzinger whatever they're
all kind of the same the more broken they are inside the more focused they are on like war and foreign policy
because it gives them a Feeling of of power and strength and success like I can't get my wife to respect me I can't
get my kids to listen to me I can't pass any meaningful domestic agenda but what
I can do is Bomb the living [ __ ] out of a foreign country and um there so there is this
it's not true for all of them but for a lot of them there is this syndrome uh that drives their behavior
but whatever the reason it's totally disconnected from what's good for the country and if you run America you have
one job one job and that's improve America period they don't see it that way and I
so I don't think the system can continue because it's too distorted it's it's not
serving its original purpose at all so what was it that these guys said that
made this raid possible they said Russia and I don't want to speak for them like
I interview anyone who wants to see it can interview and I just want to say again like one of the cool things about
this moment that I did not anticipate there's all this sad stuff happening I know that you probably experience this all the time is like finding not only
common ground with people you thought you had nothing in common with at all but also like liking them you know like
I actually liked the guy I'm sure we disagree a million things probably mad at white people I am a white person
whatever but like in my conversation I was like I like this guy you know he's honest and he's sincere he's principled
he was a veteran you know but whatever no I really think what they said was what I have said and a lot of people
have said um which is there was a reason for this Invasion I personally think the invasion was a bad idea didn't help
anybody I'm against War I'm sad the war's ongoing but they were pushed to this by a more powerful country which
would be the United States of America with the threat of including Ukraine in NATO it's really simple and
right before the invasion days before the invasion they send poor Comm Harris who has no idea what day it is to the
Munich security conference an area she knows nothing about no experience in it at all and they send her there for one
purpose which is to announce at a press briefing with all the cameras rolling to zinsky right there she says we want you
to join NATO what you no no other NATO
members were clamoring for Ukraine it didn't even qualify for NATO membership why would you say that when Clinton when
Putin's got troops masked on the Ukrainian border you send your vice president to the Munich security
conference with the world watching and say this that no one even really wants why would you do that to Prov War obviously what's the other reason and it
was scripted like KLA Harris is not freeballing stuff like she's saying what she's told to say obviously it's not her
area she doesn't know anything about this stuff she was told to say that but why to provoke a war obviously so that
was my read I said that on Fox News not a lot of people liked it but it just seemed obvious to me I'm not making
excuses for Putin please uh I want to protect the United States and I think
this war really hurts the United States like my motives are always right out there anyway I think they said a species
of that something like that and and the last thing I'll say is that why was the
reaction so strong because it was true they don't care if you lie no one in power cares if you lie but a lot of
people are say they care when you tell the truth a lot of people are saying those things and they're not getting he's like some black nationalist guy in
St Petersburg like who cares we can do who's going to defend him nobody he's some wacko he's some like 80 y old guy
who's like been in the like Fringe left movement for the past 50 years you know
like new Huey Newton and stokeley Carmichael he's like a relic of the past and like he doesn't have a constituency
he doesn't care the modern democratic party hates him he hates them and the Republican party is like black
nationalism no thanks so he has no constituency they're never going to like
you could say that and what are they going to do to you you know nothing because they're they can't but this guy
yeah crush him kill him and that's exactly what they're doing and I really think not to be like a' 70s liberal
about it if you let the weak get crushed it's bad it's super bad you need to
protect the weak and this guy's weak and so you think they're making example out of him with this and they
can they have all this power this I just don't understand why they would move so many people why why they would get so
many agents why they would do this so publicly for one guy's opinion or one
group of people's opinion well I don't know I mean why did why did medieval kings hang the heads of people they
executed from the gates right but it feels like there should be more to it like what what did they say so the the
problem is you're telling me I know the problem is that I mean I'm just straw I'm steel Manning this rather so the
problem is that they went over to Russia and they talked with people in Russia and then they're saying these things is
that the problem they're not charged with that they're not charged with going to Russia but you think that's the motivation behind it because they they
went over there this a different article uh has a quote from him okay yeah they are not C at least when I interviewed
him they had not been charged with taking money from Russia so it says they've been accused of us they've
accused us of taking money from Russia yesel said yesterday at a news conference on July 29th we've never
taken any money from Russian government but I'm not saying that because I'm morally opposed to taking money from the
Russians or anyone else who wants to support the struggles for black people don't tell us we can't don't tell us
that we can't have friends that you don't like he accused the UF government US government of seeking to use the
apsp As It Pawn in its proxy war with Russia the unsubstantiated allegation
that opponents of the war are co-conspirators with a foreign power are intended to bolster The Phantom of a
Russian Boogeyman in the public Consciousness the escalating military aggression by the us against Russia and
China is already being accompanied by increasing oppression and an attempt to
criminalize left-wing opposition to the unpopular War well exactly so they're accusing him
of taking money from Russia they're not they're not charging him so here's the distinction which is like really really
important so there are two levels on which the Department of Justice in all administrations acts there's the level
of propaganda like what do we want people to think and there's the level of law what are we charging someone with
and you have to ignore the first and pay very close attention to the second so we have a legal system we have laws and you
can't actually go to jail unless you violate one under the terms of our system and so ignore what they're saying
about you Joe Rogan sucks he's a bad man but in the end I'm busting you for double parking and so really you're not
a bad man you're a double Parker under the law and so if you look at the charges against these guys they're they're not charged with
violating sanctions regulations they are charged with
totally Amorphis quote crimes like defrauding the US government not for
money but for like defrauding it like I guess counter signaling
it sending a message publicly that they don't like I mean there's no crime look it up except
speaking and I think that's a precedent that we don't want to live with no no
doubt all right I'm G take a leak yeah let's take a leak we'll be right back we're gonna pee Tucker and I are gonna
pee together yeah well that's the the confronting of reality you're forced to
examine your beliefs and why you came to those beliefs in the first place no that is the beauty of this moment though it
is people are living uh intentionally much more and it's also just much more interesting it's not just you know it's
less shallow than it was for sure I think so I think it's more nuanced people have more Nu at least the people
that are paying attention have a more nuanced perspective but then you have the people that are in the Echo chambers that are just digging their heels in
even more and you could spot them easily because they well they're missing out because there's nothing more liberating
than admitting you were wrong MH I mean that is the that is like the moment of Liberation right and that's the basis of
religion it's the basis of AA it's the basis of anything that improves you as a person is admitting honestly admitting
to other people not just to yourself that like wow I got that wrong yeah and then you're free cuz then you don't have
to hide it anymore right very important and it's a beautiful thing and that is
like changing your mind I always notice this covering politics that you know a candidate would be like I've got him on
tape saying 10 years ago something different and no one ever asked my opinion but I always wanted to say why don't you just why don't you say you're
absolutely right and the country's a lot different from what it was 10 years ago and so my opinions changed too like why wouldn't they cuz I'm not a freaking
robot or a liar also I used to think this because of that and now I realized
I was wrong exactly yeah which how great is that I mean it's part of being a human it's not being a flip-flopper it's
the best part of being a human well this is an interesting time for that because you see people that won't do that and
you could recognize them easily because they're the first people to throw out insults the first thing they do when they describe you they'll describe you
in an insulting way and then they'll say what they disagree with you about they'll say something hard they try to
Define you they you're far right white supremacist
racist yeah they throw it all at you and then they say what you said it's so
funny I got called racist and white supremacist so many times but when I first was called that I mean it really
stung you know a lot because just of where I grew up and how I grew up and
those are like the worst things you could ever call somebody and um so I actually like paused for a moment and
thought am I like I which I think it's fair to ask yourself like am am I a wh whatever that I've never figured out
what that was am I a racist not really and I thought really the people I
dislike most are almost all white liberals actually so you're racist
against white people no but like no I I I am white my kids are white I'm not against white people I like white people
but um no it's not that it's that so a reporter once called me about this
you've been called racist like no actually really just like you if I were sort of narrow down my bigotries it's like people like you I just think you're
disgusting I really mean it too RAC racist okay all
right well it's a it's a thing you know I don't think that works as much anymore it doesn't work no well I think a lot of
the things that you overuse eventually people realize like oh you're you're you're yelling wolf again yeah well of
course and when people get hit with it and don't disappear then it becomes obvious that lacks power well it's also
you're trying to like use these words Define someone especially someone like you that has so many hours and hours of
talking about things like to to try this reductionist perspective of someone to reduce them to this ultimately very
negative thing and not say that they're a human being and also the fact that it's done by the people that want to
think of themselves as compassionate and kind which is the most bizarre the the left is so
aggressively incompassion like they they're so aggressively unkind with letting letting
people die of drug Odes on the sidewalk that's compassion no it's not that whole thing is [ __ ] crazy well it's cruelty
actually it is and it's also when you find do you know [ __ ] Noz the yeah great
guy he opened my eyes to the homelessness thing we had him on the podcast and he was explaining how he was
in San Francisco and he was like what is this is like they don't have any money for this is that what it is like no
there's a whole business behind it course and these people that are running this homelessness initiative or whatever
the [ __ ] they call it they're making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year some of them a quar million dollars a year imagine making money off the
homeless and not doing a goddamn thing but what's so funny is I I I do think the root of their power and the one
thing they're good at is just charging the moral High ground and taking it in
the first moments of the battle yeah they just run up to the moral High ground and like we've got this this is ours and they'll protect that at all
costs and it's like that's kind of all they have is this self-righteousness and if you can puncture that it's like
you're getting rich from the homeless actually yeah and is there anything more
disgusting than that it's some junkie who's dying in misery outside the
convention center in San Francisco and you're making money on that they're essentially using those people as a battery to expand the power of
government yeah their own personal Advantage yeah they're they're expanding government they're making more
government employees now there's tons of people that are working on the homelessness problem air quotes and uh
you know they probably all have blue hair and they talk nonsense and nothing's getting done and no one's
being punished for it but when they when they did that study where they said that that they had no data like how are
you what you you can't say whether or not it's doing anything yeah you well
how'd you spend $24 billion but why are they not treated as like the most
reprehensible people in our society I think there's too many things to think about I think most people unlike you and
I aren't even paying attention to it they're paying attention to the fact that the tents are are there they're paying attention to if you go to Los
Angeles it's a [ __ ] zombie apocalypse but what they're not paying attention to is what is going on how many people are
making money I didn't even know until colon explained it to us I had no idea I I thought it was just they don't have
any money they don't put any money in it and they let these people sleep there oh no no there's actual M all these parasites yeah parasites government
parasites those are real of course and you know this whole idea of I've created so many jobs like what jobs are they
government jobs that are just [ __ ] cuz there a lot of those what's crazy to me just having spent most of my life in
Washington is how close this is to the lawmakers physically so the US capital
sits across from something called Union Station which is a really beautiful train station um right on Capital Hill
and so to get into the capital you when there's a massive homeless City there people dying of drug Odes right there
and so to get to work every day lawmakers have to like step over the bodies of fellow Americans
dying like dying living Outdoors [ __ ] in the bushes addicted to drugs
which is Hell okay and they have to ignore that on their way to creating
Utopia in some foreign country and you're like does it ever occur to you
that that's disgusting that your primary duty is to the drug addict your fellow
American you're doing nothing and you're telling me how we're going to make Eastern Europe into you know this Brave
New World I don't know I just can't get past that I think I'm not super sensitive or aware
or anything I'm not super anything really I'm pretty ordinary but I think I would notice I would I was like walking
into VOD in Ukraine Aid I'd be like [ __ ] there are like five junkies on the street like maybe we should do something
for them no yeah yeah it's very bizarre it's bizarre that they can rationalize it or at least that they don't get
called out by all their people and this idea that it's compassionate that you
have compassion to leave these people and to give them Aid and to help them and give them clean needles but then
you've got to think like maybe there's something bigger going on actually because there's no yes there's
an entire sector of the economy now that feeds off of human Misery the drug
treatment centers that don't work the homeless Advocates who create more homeless the you know migrant workers
you know American Born Aid agencies workers who you know increase illegal
immig ation and gang activity and all this you know people are making money off this the arms manufacturers that
help kill people in foreign countries etc etc there's a viig and all of that it's a scam it's a grift etc etc but
like there's something more like there are a lot of people who seem to be just like for evil for its own sake and
you're like maybe all the like crazy talk about a spiritual war of like good
and evil maybe there's something to that maybe that's not an illusion maybe that's like everyone else has always
thought that there are certainly forces that have evil consequences that exists
but they act on people from the out and you feel it also on the other side I mean people are better than they
naturally are sometimes like you feel compassion for people or true empathy for someone or you you really want to
help someone there's no advantage to you at all like why are you doing that it's almost like you're being acted on by good and all of us have known those
moments where we just are cruel for the sake of it hurt someone for the sake of it what's that there's no advantage to
us that's evil acting on us and I think we're seeing it at scale and like I grew up in the most secular world you could
ever grow up in Southern California in the 70s and 80s and in a very secular
family and I've never really paid much attention to that and all of a sudden every not everyone a lot of people I
know who had similar childhoods to mine similar life experiences are like maybe
there is like a supernatural realm maybe there's more than just like what we can see
and feel maybe life is more than just ordering [ __ ] on Amazon maybe there's like a purpose maybe there is this battle between good and
evil uh around us that we can't see but that we do experience a lot it seems like it's always been a narrative
throughout human history it's always been this recognition Carls over there
snoring I don't have my headphones on so I can hear them you're snorting or snoring snoring
Carl snoring Carl the dog you oh Carl the dog Carl the dog SN oh he's the best
but he snores when he sleep cuz he's a little French Bulldog he's a sporty little Bulldog
he's awesome yeah he's the best dogs don't get cuter they might be as cute
but they don't get any cuter than Carl I think that's right yeah I've got some pretty good-looking dogs I will say yeah
I have a beautiful dog I have a golden retriever but he's not as cute as Carl Carl's a different thing don't tell him
that he knows he doesn't like Carl well he he doesn't hate Carl but he like ignores him he thinks of Carl as a thief
of attention only which he is yeah yeah fair
so we've always human beings have always at least believed that there are forces
of Good and Evil and that they they that's what exorcisms are about right
the idea that you're possessed that you're possessed by evil there's always been this thought that there's good and
evil but when did you start when did you start considering
that and thinking that that's cuz weren't you at one point in time you weren't you a a Grateful Dead head oh
yeah ien listened to him this morning yeah he used to travel around with them yeah how old were you when that was
going on um I went to my first dead show in
December of 1984 so I was 15 at speaking
of the San Francisco Civic Center yeah the New Year's shows so they always played in Oakland but one year they
played at the um in San Francisco and so we were in Tahoe over Christmas
and for some reason my my dad was gone I don't really know where so my brother and I drove illegally from Tahoe in the
family vehicle to downtown San Francisco how old was your brother 13 so you drove
or he drove I drove I drove 15 you drove yeah wow Tahoe so was a couple hours and uh I remember being on the freeway
like at 15 well we had a pretty different of childhood um but anyway uh
anyway we did is that you yeah it's me on the left get the [ __ ] out of here yeah I don't know you know I don't know
how that that picture is hanging in my barn and I've never you know I don't release any pictures of myself or family
or anything like that and somebody came to my barn and took a picture of that's hanging next to my sink and um and put
it on the internet wow so that's my brother Buckley on the right um that
picture was taken so my dad was a reporter in San Francisco in the 60s and
um pretty well-known reporter and that was in the 80s when I was in school and
we were home for Christmas vacation and he had covered the Grateful Dead he knew the Grateful Dead my dad did so they
were uh in his office they like came through DC and they like called him and they came over to his off Jerry came
over to his office and my dad's like I got Jerry garc here you guys should come down so my brother and I we lived in Georgetown and we had a vesa remember
those yeah and we drove our vesa was freaking cold out I'll never forget that we drove our vesa down to 6th and e or
whatever where my dad's office was and there was Jerry I'd never met him before he was missing the middle finger of his right hand famously you know the famous
handprint grateful that handprint and but when you shook his hand you could feel his it collapse kind of because he
didn't have that middle finger but but anyway so my brother and I drove to this to the to the New Year show was actually
a couple nights before New Year's and we didn't have tickets of course and um we were in the park across
from there and we were you know whatever doing the you know whatever things that people do at Dead shows and we were
pretty freaking out of it and this guy comes up out of nowhere and puts a
ticket around his face he goes here and hands me a ticket so my brother um was extremely
out of it I mean he was you know I never should have done this but I was like all right man I'm going in all right and I I
left my little brother in the park during the show just like very very impaired like super super impaired I it
was completely wrong to do something like that but I did do it and then I went in and saw the show kind of freaked
out in the middle of it hid in the men's room for a while never forget that standing on the the stall smoking
cigarettes is it acid trying to it was no it was uh psilocybin mushrooms which
by the way I should just say I got sober 22 years ago I'm completely opposed to anything like I don't take Adil like I'm
totally opposed to anything but um other than nicotine and coffee but yeah it was mushrooms so we ate way too many and um
started to to uh to kind of melt down a little bit but anyway the point is I get out of
the show this is pre selfa this is 1984 and I get out of the show and they
played actually a lot of tunes that they didn't play they played Spoonful like they didn't play Spoonful a lot it was
like a pretty obscure tune I'd never heard it before actually and uh I couldn't find my brother my little
brother and I'm like in charge and you know my closest friend and lifelong friends talked to him this morning and
uh but I couldn't find him and I was like oh man my brother's gone but there
he was he appeared like an hour later he had spent the entire show in somebody's
van there but he seemed undamaged and uh
it was great I mean not everything about it is great I mean I do think the drug thing got you know definitely hurt
people for sure but from my perspective I went to a bunch probably 50 or more shows and really enjoyed it and um I
love the fact that they had two drummers that was a huge thing for me I love Rhythm I think it's I think it's the
basis of music it's obviously the basis of music I mean the instrument instruments are are cool but they're kind of like interior design and the the
architecture is rhythm and it's the universal sound that every every culture
appreciates because it's it reflects something that's pre-existing that's in you everyone relates to Rhythm and I
just AB absolutely loved the drums and I love they would always play like it was called drums actually but they would
play a section of every show was just drums um Bill kin and Mickey Hart just going crazy on the drums and they had
drum circles and and I just like drums to this day I listen to drums just just
percussion King Sunny ad day um the Great West African drummer and uh anyway
whatever so yeah I like the Greatful Dead a lot and still do and I like that kind of music jam music I like J music I like
acoustic music I love blueg grass love blueg grass and Americana and to see
that grow to see Billy strings become like a venue Packer you know like Billy strings is like a big act right now I do
feel like creativity art has been completely destroyed and eliminated in the United States there's like you as we
were saying earlier you can't be creative if you're not honest it's that simple and we can't be honest so there's
no creativity and in the visual arts and literature and architecture it's Di but comedy is still alive thank heaven
and music for some reason has escaped that and is still alive yeah and the
growth the explosion of acoustic Bluegrass you know the banjo like one of
the great instruments ever um is just thrilling and like a sign of life you
know at this late at this late stage well I think when there's social pressures and when society's in chaos
art does tend to thrive some kind of art some art that's right comedy certainly
does now like comedy's never been better amazing time it came close oh yeah yeah
the walls got breached whoa no but a few a few years I don't know when it was but
you know eight years ago or something it felt like oh wow you know people can't tell jokes anymore we kept doing it I
noticed and yeah we kept doing you kept the little little Embers alive yeah well
there was it was flames it's just you you know when you get people in a club
and you take their phones away and just have them just be actual human beings and not be filming everything just being
completely trapped with this idea of capturing something and then putting it online then you get to have a human
experience you mean when people like live in the present rather than in the future far away that's one of the great
things about dat line going to a good club that uses Yonder bags for your phones is that it just takes you out of
like at the very least it's a break like like this podcast is is a break for 3
hours of phones there's no I'm not no one's checking phones love that that's
very rare with human beings where they can just sit down and just have conversations for long periods of time
without being distracted by something not in my house but yeah it's a real problem with folks it's a huge problem
it's a huge problem and I the one thing I will say about my very unconventional childhood is there was a huge premium on
meals and like eating with people and spending 4 hours at the table was
like totally normal in the house that I grew up in totally normal in fact it was like daily and um that was our primary
form of entertainment and mode of communication and you know thing that we did for fulfillment and fun and I still
do that I still feel that way and we have dinner parties constantly and there are no phones and people talk and
entertain each other and it's like it's so much more interest I'm not on social media but if I were on social media I
don't think I would find that on Instagram I'm just and I'm not attacking Instagram but I don't think I would find
that anything like that no it's it's it's definitely a lost thing and it's
such an easy thing it's such a fun thing it is a fun thing yeah it's a great thing and I think people enjoy it I
think that's also led to the rise of podcast too because they don't they don't get that in their real life so at least they get to be a person who sits
in on these conversations I got to say this is not being suck upy cuz I don't suck up ever to anyone but the effect
that podcasts have had is just is just incredible and I never would have
predicted that in million freaking years I would have never thought it when when
I first started doing this it was in my living room with my friend Brian and we did it on a laptop and we had a webcam
and we were like with my friend Brian yeah Brian redband of kill Tony you met Bri yes I did I just no but I just love
the phrase with my friend Brian like every bad story like my friend Brian we
were we were down to Mexicali and I just me and my friend Brian we just started [ __ ] around online and then then we
started eventually bringing in guests and then we eventually got a studio and then eventually I got you know a big
place in La like a real warehouse and then eventually moved to Texas it it all
just eventually happened but it's it was not I mean I was in another part of
media for that whole period And if you had asked me up until the last few years like the future is clearly shorter
crisper more produced right right everybody would have thought that exactly everyone did think that
including me and I hated it you know I hat it I like long form but I never I was a long form magazine writer for
years so I I thought but I thought that was over yeah not over everybody thought
that yeah even my friends they were telling me how to edit my show they're like you should edit that no one's going to listen at 3 hours I'm like then don't
listen okay do whatever you want I'm not I'm not making any money doing this it was just
for fun I love that it was just fun for years for years and years I did it just
with no money there was no money in it forever what year like how many years in did it start to pay for itself
five that's a long time yeah a long time it was took a while I mean it was making
it was probably like sub existing yeah but about 5 years in then
it started making money and then it was like oh this is a business I remember very clearly I was on stage Once in Chicago I was doing the Chicago theater
and I had this story that I was going to tell I'm like how many people listen to the podcast and there's 3,700 people in
the place and they went nuts it was like yeah and I was like
oh like I thought there was this like thing that I'm doing where you know a few people are paying attention I don't
even know what the I didn't even back then I never even knew what the numbers were I didn't I didn't even care just
well they may not have been like could you even collect numbers accurately yeah you can get downloads off of uh you know
like the whatever the uh provider was that was um with the host you could get
like download numbers from the host and they they would use that to inform ads like oh he gets x amount of downloads
per month and then they would you know that's when there's very few people advertising on podcast all right let's
give it a try but it's one of the great developments between
podcasting and Billy strings like I have I'm serious I have hope that it's not
all going in the wrong direction cuz you can get this view that like everything is falling apart late Rome yeah just a
matter of time before you know it really does collapse and then you see these signs that are not minor you know
they're significant that like no people I mean I haven't met a person in the
past year who said you know I thought this but then I was reading the New York Times and I realized I was wrong like
not one person right but the number of people say I was listening to this podcast I was listening to Rogan and d d
it's like yeah really noticeable yeah that's why it's
interesting it's it's it's interesting because you could put people in front of people and they might not even be right
they might be wrong but at least now you're having conversations about something you would never have a
conversation about before and even if this person gets exposed as being incorrect well now you have a more
nuanced understanding of what the subject is about why people think incorrect things and you know this idea
of like platforming people is a big one today why would you platform that person first of all platform is not a verb and
whenever they take a perfectly good noun and turn it into a verb you know something bad is a foot okay platform Oh
you mean letting an adult human being talk right I think that's not only allowed I think that's the law not only
that I think it's important for us it's even important to talk to people that are completely different than you that
don't agree with you at all well it's especially important otherwise it's just masturbatory it's it's interesting it's
just you alone getting yourself off but it's also interesting to know why these people think the way they think and I
and also there's so many people that if you talk to them online you'd have these horrible conversations but if you sit
down with them as an actual human being and treat them with respect and consideration you talk to them like a
human being and you just try to be as friendly and open possible as possible despite what your differences might be
you realize most people have a lot in common a lot more way more in common than they don't but that's the secret
that they're trying to hide yeah so mind control you know the end stage of Mind Control is censorship right but it
begins long before that and it begins by creating false categories that wall off
your willingness that prevent you from wanting to know certain things or talk to certain people and name calling is a
the most obvious tool like he's a crank he's a racist he's a whatever fill it in and then you're like I can't listen to
that person and I have to say your willingness to platform or to have a
conversation with Alex Jones I think was a revolutionary act actually not that everything Alex Jones
says is right it's not not everything I say is right or anyone says is right but Alex Jones is an interesting person
and even if he's not interesting he has been walled off from the rest of us yeah through name calling and your
willingness to be like no actually we're just going to listen Alex Jones and you can decide for yourself well Alex has been my friend for more than 20 years
well I well exactly but even if he just the yeah but I'm sure you have other friends you haven't
invited and just like you were not allowed to talk to him and when you hear Alex Jones talk you may not agree with
everything he says I don't know that I do but you definitely understand why they told you you couldn't listen to
Alex J well that's one of the reasons why I had him as one of the first guests when I came over to Spotify love that I
was like let's go what did they say well a lot of people weren't happy we lost sponsors it was it was an
issue um but I think it it did the the job you know it it regardless of what he
said that's incorrect clearly the Sandy Hook thing was incorrect you know Alex I know Alex personally so I know what he
was going through and you know everybody wants to talk about mental health and they want to um praise people for being
honest about their mental health issues and support them on their mental health journey to Wellness Alex has gone
through some real issues and one of the reasons why he's gone through some issues is because that guy is uncovering
real [ __ ] that's terrifying every [ __ ] day and he was drinking out of control and you know he's just [ __ ]
constantly stressed freaking out and when you see so many lies and and so
much propaganda and and so many scops that are being done on people you start
seeing them where they don't exist and that's what he did well and he's also um channeling some stuff there's you can't
call 911 in detail because you're super informed before the fact he called it he
literally called it in the summer of 2001 he said planes will fly into the World Trade Centers and they will blame
a man called Osama Bin Laden we know that he said that cuz he he said it on tape multiple times and then he said call the White House and tell them this
now let's just that's all we know about Alex Jones let's just say that's the fact set how'd that happen right how did
he do that no he's channeling something that's super yeah of course yeah there's
like no other I mean tell me how he did it otherwise I've asked him about it how did you do that at length he had dinner
in my barn recently we're talking about this how did you do that I don't know it just came to me and that's real that is
real the super superal is real and I don't know why it's so hard for for the modern mind guess cuz it's a materialist
mind to accept that but what you see and that's not a new phenomenon that's happened throughout history there were
people called prophets and there are people who were prophets who weren't called prophets but there are people who
have information or parts of information bits of information visions of information come to them and then they
relay it it's not from them they received it this is like the you know one of the oldest phenomenon in human in
human history so those people tend to be a little crazy a little imbalanced a
little different from everybody else do you know what I mean they live on Locust and honey in the in the wilderness I mean that's just like that's they're not
like everybody else and that's clearly part of what I'm not saying that everything that Alex Jones says is a
prophecy from God it's not but that was prophetic there's and if it wasn't tell
me how it wasn't in in July of 2000 like I lived in Washington in July of 2001
you know my dad worked in the government like I was as well informed as anybody could be about what was going on in the government I've always been interested
in what's happening in other countries I was aware of Assam Bin Laden I knew about the Taliban I knew you know more than most people there's not one person
who was saying not one person in Washington DC was saying you know at some point soon they may fly airplanes
into the World Trade Centers and blame oam Bin Laden like that just wasn't a thing so if you said that multiple times
on camera there 's a reason like and and everyone I've said this to 50 people
what I just said to you and they all look at me like yeah that's stupid tell me how it's stupid like tell me how he did that like
that's that's impossible actually he didn't just do it with that either no I'm aware he's done it with a lot of things and that's one of the more
interesting things about him is that like he he talks about Stu like he talked about like I'm going to send this
to Jamie cuz this is one of the really crazy ones that he he called and this is
like 2000 um 2000
probably I guess
2017 here it is let me find this give me a second here I find because I I sent it
to him like how the [ __ ] did you call this because it's it's one of those ones where you're like this is exactly what's
happening now here it is here 2017 hold on a second
I'll send you this Jamie come
on technology let's go all right I sent it to you
Jamie so this is some guy's Instagram clip that I found that took a clip from
the podcast and he's doing commentary over put these on things on real quick
you got it yeah okay
cool here we go 22 years on podcast Infowars Alex Jones and Joe Rogan
discuss what's currently happening right now Google CERN technology vampires
aliens in a nutshell Alex was pretty on point with this man message let me know
what your thoughts are is he crazy or is he on to something it's really big so
okay um yeah pour another shot of that get this out proper all right let me give you my best
deep research Proclamation once you what do you think is going but am I wrong to still hold out hope that aliens are real
because I tell you as one the two guilty pleasures that I still cling to is Bigfoot and Aliens those are two Bigfoot
not so much I wish it was real but I just don't are you ready yes Bigfoot real no come on Daddy no are you ready
yes I'm going to give you the big out of Joe there are aliens in this room right now for real yeah you're not of this world bro me you're the alien oh wow I
didn't know well here's what the elite believe and let me be very clear asz the media I'll take this out of context I
only go with what I can prove oh thank you and people can't even handle that there's armies we're fighting a pedophile conspiracy but beyond that
it's a vampire conspiracy in that they are interdimensionally sucking the essence of our youth right and they
believe they're possessed by an offworld entity they do yeah and Joe I've been on air 22 years I don't get into aliens
metaphysical religion any of that I've studied the elite and I've also communicated with a lot of the top people and and if you want to know I
will actually break down right now the best knowledge right now what's happening on the planet what's
happening the elite are all about Transcendence and living forever and the secrets of the universe and they want to
know all this are good some are bad some are a mix but the good ones don't ever want to organize the bad ones didn't
want to organize because they lost after power powerful consciousnesses don't want to dominate other people they want
to empower them so they don't tend to get together until things are really late in the game then they come together Evil's always defeated because good is
so much stronger and we're on this planet and Einstein's physics shut it Max Plank's physics shut it all there's
at least 12 dimensions and now that's why all the top scientists and billionaires are coming out saying it's a false hologram it is artificial the
computers are scanning it and finding tension points where it's artificially projected and gravity's bleeding in to
this universe that's what they call Dark Matter so we're like a thought or a dream that's a wisp in some computer
program some God's mind whatever they're proving it all it's all coming out now
there's like this sub transmission Zone below the third dimension that's just turned over the most horrible things is
what it resonates to and it's trying to get up into the Third di menion that's just a basic level Consciousness to
launch into the next levels and our species is already way up at the fifth sixth Dimension consciously our best
people but there's this big war trying to like basically destroy Humanity because Humanity has Free Will and
there's a decision to which level we want to go to we have free will so Evil's allowed to come and contend not
just good and the elites themselves believe they're racing using
human technology to try to take our back minds and build some type of breakaway
civilization where they're going to merge with machines transcend and break away from the fail species that is man
which is kind of like a false transmission because they're thinking what they are is ugly and bad projecting it onto themselves instead of believing
no it's a human test about building us up and so Google was set up 18 19 years
ago this was I knew about this before it was Declassified I'm just saying I've good sources that they wanted to build a giant artificial system and Google
believes that the the first artificial intelligence will be a supercomputer based on the neuron activities of the
hive mind of humanity with billions of people wired into it with the internet of things and so all of our thoughts go
into it and we're actually building a computer that has real neurons in real time that's also psychically connected
to us that are organic creatures so that they will have current prediction Powers
future prediction Powers a true Crystal Ball but the big secret is once you have
a crystal ball and know the future you can add stimuli beforehand and make decisions that control the future and so
then it's the end of Consciousness and Free Will for individuals as we know and a true 2.0 in a very bad way hi mind
Consciousness with an AI jacked into everyone knowing our hopes and dreams delivering it to us not in some PKD
wirehead system where we plug in and give up on Consciousness because of unlimited pleasure but because we were already wired in and absorbed before we
knew it by giving over our conscious to this system by our daily decisions that it was able to manipulate and
control into a larger system there's now a human Counterstrike taking place to shut this off before it gets fully into
place and to block these systems and to try to have an actual debate about where Humanity goes and cut off the pedophiles
and psychic vampires that are control of this AI system before humanity is destroyed of AI how' they get how' the
pedophile is that it yeah it's pretty much [Laughter] it it's incredible
it's I understand about that was seven years ago years ago yeah okay so no
seven years ago no one was thinking AI was going to take over Civ you can see why the FBI decided to destroy him which
it did um the people in I mean it's just like what has happened to Alex Jones is
proof that at least some of what he's saying is true because what why who is Alex Jones a threat to did you see that
interview with the guy from FBI was trying to hook up with that dude on a date CIA yeah was it CIA that's right
and they they were talking about how they can destroy a person yeah I think I was mentioning there too were you I was
um yeah I mean there are a couple okay so yeah again I don't the third
dimension I don't unknow anything about Dimensions okay so I can't comment on that but two things he said um are true
one um is that every civilization every religion the Greek myths you know every
single one including Judaism Christianity Hinduism uh has believed that there
is sort of that the spirit world and Humanity are like that there's
you know they're hybrids yeah okay so that's just a fact Genesis 6 um so you
know I don't think that's crazy at all uh given that it has been the belief of civilizations that had no contact with
each other I don't think it's crazy and I also don't think it's crazy to cons considerate I don't think we have a real
map of reality well we definitely don't and I exact better put than I than I
explained that's exactly right we don't have a real map and it's not crazy to consider it and it was a very it was an entirely conventional view up until
fairly recently um that yeah that this the spirit world like I hate want don't
face breeds with people but that is that everyone thought that okay right and even the term spirit world is probably a
loaded term of course they're all Lo terms how do you say it in a way that doesn't sound crazy but the whole thing
sounds crazy because we don't acknowledge the reality the actual physical reality of the Supernatural and it Israel that's the first thing the
second Point that's obviously true is that people uh weak people which is a
synonym for bad people come together for strength and safety they act as one the
hive mind is a is specific to a certain group of people bad people and that good
people don't to come together but they're coming together now and I just not I just noticed this I mean people
independently who I know or sort of know in many cases have long despised have come to exactly the same conclusions
without talking to each other MH I know that you have this experience all the time yeah it's like I can't believe you
think that how did you wind up thinking that right and not just on a specific issue like foreign policy or covid or
whatever but like on a whole bunch of different things they're all coming to the same conclusion and they're coming together and so that does
suggest you know uh big a big change and a battle I mean it is a battle between
good and evil I'm not always convinced I'm on the good side I've been you know an instrument of evil many times in my
life and I'm ashamed of it but are you talking about the Iraq War yeah the Iraq War I've been cruel to people probably
even already on your show in ways that are unjustified that's my instinct to do that that's a fault not you know not
something to brag about it's something ashamed of so I'm not I'm not saying I'm always on the right side I certainly have not always been on the right side I've been on the wrong side many many
times but that doesn't change the fact that there is good there is evil they are at war with each other and we
are subject to the effects of that conflict and that we're seeing it suddenly play out in ways that are
really really obvious there's no political explanation for the trans phenomenon nobody benefits you can say I
hear these see these right Wingers be like really it's all about the people who make synthetic hormones they benit yeah okay they benefit it's not driving
it that's stupid it's not about the money actually there's no upside it's not helping the kids at all if a child
has anorexia which is pretty common actually in this country and the child thinks she's fat you don't say to the
child yeah you're fat you you don't do that you give the child help if you can it's hard to treat
but you you try if a child comes to you and says actually I think I was born in the wrong body the last thing you do is
affirm that it's hurting the child like why would you do that if you love the child you wouldn't do that it's really an EXC excise undertaken for the sake of
Destruction the sake of hurting someone there's no real upside what's another
phrase description of that it's evil and um you see that a lot a lot yeah and
um why like what is that what is it and why is it so obvious to a completely
even a completely secular person like me all of a sudden um there's a reason for that we're watch you know history is
moving really really fast we're right in the middle of it and I probably wouldn't
have chosen to be born at the time I was I'd much rather sort of reach maturity in 1955 really you know well I don't
know I don't get to choose you know I don't like drama I don't like change like I'm there was drama and change back then there there was but it people
didn't rec well there was a cold war of course there was a Korean War okay but people didn't see it in their face right
in the way I don't think would you rather know but I don't have a choice I do know yeah I'd rather know I'd rather be right now
yeah well you've got a much better attitude than I I mean sometimes I just my parents got divorced when I was little and so I kind of like I don't
want change yeah I know to me I know what you mean um you know um I was
having a conversation in the green room with the club the other night about this uh guy from Canada that's uh HIV
positive that's a transom that's taking hormones so they can breastfeed their 9-month-old
daughter so a biological male is taking hormones and is now breastfeeding their
daughter off of their male tit and I said if I was Satan if Satan was real I would do that exactly if I was if
Satan's real I would I mean if Satan was going to do something Insidious and and
unbelievably creepy he would do that well I think he is doing that obviously but this guy's a a real freak well but
right using public money too but he's a victim too I mean the thing about right because
the thing about evil the reason that evil is distinct from everything else it destroys the vessel it's held in the
conduit through which it flows destroys the person so like that guy in the end
will not Thrive right he'll be destroyed too and so that's how you know that it's
supernatural in other words if I you know if I steal your iPhone and sell it and I get an extra 400
like that's kind of explicable you understand why I'm doing that I want the 400 bucks right but if I'm encouraging
your kid to castrate himself I'm not really benefiting from that actually
there's no material benefit to me at all there's no real psychic benefit it's it's hurting for its own sake and um and
that's evil that's there's no political category that explains that right and then there's clearly money involved in that too there is money of there's the
gender affirming clinics that have popped up all over the country since 2007 you see the map of it's [ __ ]
bananas but why would you want to do that that's why would policy makers want to do that why would anybody want to
make money that way right why would they Cho to make Mone people it's the most unnatural thing ever because parents
every parent at a certain age feels is like I I like my kids I want grandkids you want to protect your children to
continue yeah from bad decision so I always think the politicians who push trism on the country like their kids are
going trans too yeah they are right they're not escaping it it's like they're burning down their own house I
would like to see the statistic of people in Hollywood like how many of their kids turn trans versus the rest of
the world yeah I know some of them too but how many of them versus the rest of the world well a lot more a lot more
which is a a morally corrupt business yes yeah like more than we knew more
than I knew you know the entertainment business it's it's always been that way you know Tarantino was talking to us
about um this famous old director that had a a bedroom in his office where he
would bed the starlets and it was just common knowledge that if you wanted to be in his movie you had to [ __ ] him and
you'd go into his office he had a literal bedroom in his office we had some of that in television yes I'm sure
yeah quite a bit yeah and I didn't I didn't really understand I didn't you
know obviously partake in it or you would know because all my text messages went up in the New York Times so um I'm
not hiding any of my own behavior but I mean I I will say if I'm being honest it didn't really register with me I was
like yeah that's kind of wild and crazy I just didn't you know like like my wife I didn't want to blow up my family I didn't do anything like that really but
I certainly saw a lot like a lot of it like a lot and I just didn't really see it as like horrifying I just saw it as
kind of like well you know creative people are this way kind of thing but I look back and I'm like it was really dark well especially the producer thing
right that like the Weinstein thing that the the way they ran the business that
that's how it was pay to play I worked for Harvey Weinstein for a year did you really yeah I did when 19 99 uh he had a
magazine um with Tina Brown called Talk magazine I was the head political writer
for it and they had an office at carnegi Towers in New York right below the park
and uh and I remember the big con I mean I remember he was a pig I was not like an intimate friend of his or whatever but I certainly dealt with him and the
big controversy was he was smoking in elevators and um that was and I've kind
of supported that if I'm being honest but um but he was considered incredibly insensitive and just like vulgar a pig
well he looks vulgar yeah well that was certainly what everyone thought of him where I worked Harvey's just a pig and
his brother Bob was a little bit less that way he was also involved but um but yeah people knew that he was a bad guy
but like but he made awesome movies yeah and and also but he was just
powerful it's like hary Weinstein like I want to [ __ ] with hary Weinstein I mean I didn't really think about it too much to be completely honest that was just it
was just a guy I worked for but um I don't know I didn't I certainly if you'd
played that Alex Jones clip for me in 1999 I would have been and I did see Alex Jones Clips in 1999 and then in
later years where he was talking about building seven and I was very offended I was like outraged that he would be
suggesting that there was something about 9/11 that wasn't above board that there were you know things we didn't know that were being hidden from us and
I was like mad at Alex Jones for saying that I remember that really well how dare you the building 7 one is wild well
it is W it is wild I mean I have no all I know is 20 one I don't even know what year it is 23
years could it really be 23 years after 911 23 years later what's the justification for classifying any
document around 911 there's no justification well the same justification of classifying the documents about the Kennedy assassination exactly 61 years later
yeah or releasing the covid vaccine data 75 years later of course yeah right I
mean it's of look secrecy is different from privacy privacy is necessary for
the Dignity of this white you've got a door in the bathroom and your bedroom right you know you need privacy you need private thoughts we have no privacy
whatsoever none no privacy at all thanks to the to the iPhone and government spying on us all so there's no privacy
but there's massive secrecy secrecy is different secrecy of bets lying the only reason to have secrecy is in order to do
something that you're ashamed of other people knowing about that's that's immoral and probably illegal and there's
more secrecy than ever and that means that there's more lying than ever there
are more crimes being committed than ever that's the shest sign of it why are there a billion classified documents in
a So-Cal democracy because they're lying to us that's why but 9911 like what is the justification for
that I don't know the answer I really don't know the answer but there is one that's for sure yeah it's not methods
and sources you think it's methods and sources trying to protect their Saudi sources I don't think so you know the
wildest thing about Tower 7 is that if you just say it looks like a controlled
demolition people get mad at you why well I don't know because I'm not saying that is a controlled demolition but I'm
saying if you watch it it looks like a controlled demolition but that happens
all the time buildings Catch Fire and they just implode in on themselves I think happens every week right all these
poultry plants and manufacturing plants that keep getting burned uh Through Fire
they all like it's the way it went down yeah so I say why do they respond that
way and of course I responded that way um so when I think looking back the
reason that I did was because because if you call that into question you had to ask a lot of other really obvious
questions you didn't want to deal with and you might arrive at the conclusion that a lot of your most basic assumptions are false and that you've
been had and it's just too destabilizing maybe right well the real problem with Tower 7 is they go well okay if it was a
controled demolition how was that engineered did they just decide to do that before September 11th and you know
how long it would take to rig a building like that right or was it built into the building and how would they know would
even work and how would they do something like that and how would there not be a record of it being built into the building like for someone to
engineer and where's the sound signature on the on the tape there would be a sound of the explosions going which is a
fair question yeah a lot of fair questions and has there ever been a building that experienced a tremendous
amount of damage because two enormous skyscrapers fell right next to it
damaged it and then massive fire started and then there's diesel generators that are in the base so they have all this
fuel so they have this incredible Inferno in the basement that weakens the structure and is that why it collapsed
maybe to totally possible um a lot of building Engineers disagree with that as you know yeah and um they don't think
that could have happened uh in the way you just described I'm agnostic on it what I because I don't know the answer
and I have no way of knowing all I know is that there's no justification for keeping those documents secret that I
can think of and if there is tell tell us what it is no one has bothered cuz nobody presses and it's you know I'll
add that to the list of outrages yeah you know what I mean and then it it gives you this feeling of helplessness
because there's so many of those they just pile on there's always another one there government spied on me broke into
my phone and spied on me and I couldn't get a straight answer to that and I'm I'm not a felon and I'm well not only
that they used they got into your signal account right yeah and then they leaked it to the New York Times what they found
there so it's one thing to say okay we picked up your text exchanges with a
foreign National which is true um I text a lot of foreign Nationals because of my job like why
wouldn't I and it's my right as far as I'm concerned that's not illegal but we picked up your text exchanges which I
think itself is a lie I think they were targeting me I think they are now um I know I'm pretty positive they are but
whatever leaving that aside we spied on you we think we have justification is there a justification for leaking the
contents of my private conversation to a news outl in order to discredit me no there's no that's secret police [ __ ]
okay yeah I'm not whining I'm a victim I'm certainly not a victim but what was infuriating was my to and I got members
of Congress involved because I was pissed and I felt threatened I couldn't get a straight answer they were just like we're not
answering those questions and what are you going to do about it [ __ ] what are you g to do about it you know I don't I don't possess a
drone Fleet there's nothing I can do about it actually that's the truth so when the system breaks down and things
like I don't know honesty Justice the laww none of those apply the
people in charge decide that doesn't apply to me you are literally powerless and um bizarre that the New
York Times wouldn't have an issue with that well the New York Times does that all the time but but but bizarre they
wouldn't have an issue with the government tapping into your phone they work for the government are you kidding the New York Times yeah the New York
Times is a conduit for the lies of government that's what it is it's their tool and they're perfectly aware of that
I mean I used to write for the New York Times as a freelancer I mean I've been around the New York Times a lot and there uh yeah there are a lot of really
smart people there for sure even now I would less so now but there's still I think smart people there there are I
know some and they know but they think that that you know it's worth it because
they're bringing information I don't know what they think actually but no they're they're
tools of power and that's like the one thing that you're not allowed to be even if you think the power is good like
maybe they all support the agenda of the US Government destabilizing the world and impoverishing their own population
maybe they're on board with that even if they are they shouldn't do it because the job of the media the
Press is to keep power in check you are
kind of like the seat belt right you know you make sure that things don't go too far so um and
they're not doing that they're acting as a willing handmaiden when do you think that switched I think it's been the case
for a long time I mean if you look at what happened to Richard Nixon which I of course did not understand at all um
Richard Nixon was taken out by the FBI and CIA and um with the help of Bob Bob
Woodward who was a Washington Post reporter who had been a naval intelligence officer working in the
White House working in the Nixon White House and then he shows up like a year
later and he's this brand new reporter never been a journalist at all he's a naval Intel officer the famous Bob
Woodward we all rever and he's at the Washington Post and somehow he gets the biggest story in
the history of the Washington Post he's the lead guy in that story well I I worked at a newspaper I've been in the news business my whole life that is not
how it works you don't take a kid like his first day from a totally unrelated business and put him on the biggest
story but he was he was that guy and who is his main source for water date oh the
number two guy at the FBI oh so you have the naval intelligence officer working with the
FBI official to destroy the president okay so that's a deep State coup what
else how would you describe that if that happened in Guatemala what would you say and yet the way it was framed in the way
that I accepted for decades was oh this Intrepid reporter fought power no no no
this Intrepid reporter Bob Woodward was a tool of power secret power which is the most threatening kind to
bounce the single most popular president in American History Richard Nixon from office before the end of his term and
replace him with who oh Gerald Ford who sat on the Warren Commission Now how did
Gerald Ford get to be Richard Nixon's Vice President well because Carl Albert the Democrat Speaker of the House told
him you must choose him we will only confirm him when they sent the actual elected vice president away for tax
evasion SPO agnu of Maryland so you have a complete setup like an ABS
Gerald Ford the only unelected president in American history actually sat on the Warren Commission something else that I
accepted at face value until I looked at it I was like that's completely insane you didn't want to interview Jack Ruby in your investigation of the
assassination okay you're fake yeah he was on the warrant commission and so uh
sorry for the long story but the point is like that that happened in front of all of us but the way it was framed
cloaked the obvious reality of it the people broke into the Watergate office building from which the name is taken
Watergate was I think it was six of them or seven of them all but one was a CIA
employee that that's real it's like look it up on Google so the whole thing
Richard Nixon was elected by more votes than any president in American history
in the 1972 election he was the most popular by votes which is the only way we can really measure popularity the
most popular president in his election campaign and two years later he's gone undone by a
naval Intel officer the number two guy at the FBI and a bunch of CIA employees you tell me what that is those are the
facts those are not disputed facts that's not crackpot [ __ ] that's just look it up so why did they want to get
rid of Nixon um you know there are a lot of theories on that I mean we don't first
of all we don't need to know motive to know what happened they meaning unelected federal employees got rid of
Richard Nixon which is the most anti-democratic way to make a leadership change that there is okay I should just
say at the outet I actually kind of believe in democracy obviously it's not working well obviously it's ending globally there will never be another
liberal democracy unfortunately but I'm attached to it because I was born here I really believe in it and it's better
than any other system so that's why I'm pissed what was their motive there are a lot of theories on
this there's an amazing convers ation on tape um between Richard Nixon when he
was still president I think it was in 1973 and I think it was Richard Helms the head of the CIA though I may have
[ __ ] that up but it was the head of the CIA I think it was Helms um and Nixon says I know why they killed Jack
Kennedy so Nixon was a student of History obviously a flawed and complicated person but a very very smart
person and he was really interested in why this guy who'd been president just one president before him was murdered
and he didn't think it was a lone gunman who was mysteriously assassinated two days later by another lone gunman like
it's so obviously [ __ ] and he knew that and he said to say a director who and you can listen to the tape that's on
the internet is totally silent on this question so I think there was the
impression I don't think I know that Nixon understood that the bureaucracy was really in control of the country it
wasn't elected officials and that's a massive threat um because it's
true so and there may have been other reasons too that I'm not privy to look all I and by the way I didn't even know
any of this despite having moved to Washington in high school and been around this stuff a lot a lot a lot I
didn't know any of and I know Bob Woodward personally so I didn't and I Know Carl Bernstein personally I even work for Carl Bernstein briefly so I I
knew some of the actual players in this but I didn't connect the obvious dots because they weren't framed that way
that's the point I'm making it's the way that you frame things you can have all the information available on Wikipedia
which is also controlled by the Intel agencies but it there's still information on there the information can
be out there in the public domain it's a matter of seeing it for what it
is right yeah so Nixon said that he knew why they
killed JFK MH did he elaborate nope and it's worth listening to it's a
very weird conversation that takes place in the oval office which famously had tape recording
devices in it obviously this became a big feature during the Watergate hearings um but yes that conversation
and I may be mangling it slightly but it's on the internet and absolutely worth listening to and the CIA director
has this kind of sinister silence so like if if I'm the president you're the CIA director and I say I know why the
guy who is just president 10 years ago was killed the obvious answer would be like well why right why why you what you know
why he was killed you've got insight into the assassination of a US president he doesn't say
anything is like a very weird response like what just kind of throw that out
there like if you say to me you know we're taking a leak you're at the next Journal you're like I figured out the secret to life and I'm like huh
okay that's like not a good response right right right it's a telling
response did you hear Trump's take on the JFK assassination why he didn't release the files I know it
he said that if you knew what I know you wouldn't tell people either which is crazy well that's his
position on the UAP thing as well yeah actually um and that's a lot of people's
position on it I mean you know Trump is saying of course the CIA had knowledge of it that is
known um I mean I mean the whole thing it's like
it's so funny there's so many levels and there's so much I don't understand but the whole JFK conspiracy industry and it
really is an industry more books written on that than almost any historical topic um is is filled with wackos right there
are a lot of wackos in there but it obscures that fact obscures the larger
fact which is the facts themselves tell an unbelievable story yeah and so um
whatever I could get into it at Great length but yeah um yeah they they're still classifying documents 61 years
later both Trump and Joe Biden have in violation of my read of federal law kept
those documents secret there's no living person connected to the Kennedy assassination it was a couple
Generations ago there's no one person who's whose secrets are being protected
it's an institution or maybe countries there may have been countries involved too I mean I don't know the answer but
there's clearly something worth protecting and I know that when I I spoke to someone who seen the documents
okay two years ago and I got um I got one fact out of them which is yes the
CIA was involved and by CIA CIA is a huge organization but James Jesus Angleton the head of the operations
directorate had knowledge of this which I think is well known but that that's the view of someone who saw the documents so I thought that was news so
I went on TV and said that um the next day I'll never forget it I went quail hunting and I was
driving back and I got a phone call from Mike pompeo's lawyer Mike Pompeo was the
Secretary of State but before then he was the director of the CIA and in that position he plotted the murder of Julian
Assan so he is a criminal as far as I'm concerned but um his lawyer called me and said you know you should know that
anyone who tells you the contents of classified documents has committed a crime he's threatening me he in my car
I'll never with my dog sitting next to I'll never forget this and I said are you really saying that to reveal that
the US government had a role in the murder of a democratically elected president to say that out loud that's
the crime what about the actual crime which is murdering a president like you're covering up for that
Mike he had no no response at all and so Mike Pompeo is the one who
pressed Trump to keep those documents secret and so it's like what's crazy to me is not just that Pompeo did that I
think Pompeo is a really Sinister person and a and a criminal I think that I think that because the facts suggest
that he was caught Yahoo news Mike isakov wrote a long piece on this several years ago his employees went to
Mike iskov and said hey Mike Pompeo is plotting to murder Julian Assange who has never even been charged with a crime
in the United States as CI director that's illegal you're not allowed federal employees are not allowed to
just kill people they don't like okay just to set the Baseline here so
that's who Mike Pompeo is but he somehow intimidated Trump into not releasing
this well okay that's all bad right I think it's criminal Behavior what's crazy is how Mike Pompeo is treated he's
treated as like a republican Puba in good standing he fully expects to become
the secretary of defense in a trump Administration which is like completely insane why would you take a criminal and give him nuclear weapons okay that's my
view I think it's a common sense View and like he goes to fundraisers and dinners and everyone's like hey Mike
Pompeo it's like no you're the guy who kept information the public has a right
to no secret you're the guy who plotted the murder of someone who committed no crime you are the outlaw you are the bad
guy but no he's treated as like you know like a pillar of Republican Washington I
think that's I think it's mindbending to watch that and by the way you know
whatever that's all I'll say by the way no I mean you know people don't say that cuz they're worried getting punished
they're worried about someone putting Kitty porn on their computer members of Congress are terrified of the Intel
agencies I'm not guessing at that they've told me that including people on the Intel committee including people who
run the Intel committee the people whose job it is to oversee and keep in line
these enormous secretive agencies whose budgets we can't even know they're black
budgets they the parents the agencies are the children they're afraid of the
AG gencies that's not compatible with democracy democracy is a really simple
system even representative democracy like ours the people rule they do so through elections they express their
preference through voting they send their people to the capital city to run the government on their behalf whenever
you have unelected people who are not accountable to anyone making the biggest decisions you don't have a democracy you
have something else another system I would call it a tyranny or whatever you want to call it it's not a democracy so that's like super obvious it's playing
out in front of everyone and no one cares and no one does anything about it and I and I think the reason is because
they're threatened and if you look at the committee chairman who allow this [ __ ] to happen year after year they're
all and I don't know people say oh they're compromised they're being blackmailed whatever I don't have evidence of that but I know them and
they all have things to hide I know that for a fact and so it's not a stretch of imagination to imagine that you know
some committee chairman who's allowing warrantless spying on Amer Americans to continue or whatever abuse they're
allowing knowing fully or hiding the truth about uaps ignoring the UAP disclosure Act of 2023 like why are they
doing that it's not impossible to imagine that some guy with a drinking problem or a weird sex life and that's
very common very common up there that's why they're doing it because they don't want to be exposed I don't I don't have
evidence of that I don't have proof of that right but that that's not a crazy thing to assume that that could be
happening and I said to somebody a very powerful person
the other day in a conversation in my kitchen an elected official holds a really senior position a very famous
person I was going crazy I was so mad about all this stuff and about the warrantless spying and about the funding
for these insane Wars and I said to the guy who serves in one of the legislative
bodies like got so mad my dogs were afraid they're like well why are you yelling because I don't yell at home but I was like all these people are
controlled they're all you know got weird sex lives and all these things are hiding and they're being blackmailed by
the Intel agencies and he said that I'm quoting I know I was like are we okay so at this
point we're just sort of we're just sort of admitting that's real like how why do we allow that to continue the having
people compromise thing God that's an old story it's the oldest story J G Hoover I mean it's it's it's uh all of
them it's Epstein's Island it's everything but look I don't have any I'm telling you I'm What's The Phrase the
finance guys use open kimono like I'm actually telling you all I know I don't know anything else right um but I know
that the publicly available facts tell a really clear story which is the government is not acting on behalf of
the population and so it's inherently illegitimate because its only legitimacy
derives from the citizenry the only reason the government can do things that it does kill people collect money by
force all the powers that it has come from one place and that's the consent of the government that's the only
legitimacy they have and that's where it's fascinating this concept of Good and Evil because when you think about it
if this is true and if these people are compromised because they're secretly
perverts and creeps they are though and they're corrupt and they they steal
money or they all these different things are evil things lying controlling people
uh engaging in unnecessary Wars that are going to cost thousands of lives for profit all these things are evil things
so if evil is real evil would want those kind of people to be in a position of
power yes and here's evil would want men to breastfeed their children here's the like op here's the here's the illusion
that we fall for time and again we imagine that evil comes like fully
advertised as such like evil people look like Anton Le yeah you know what I mean black cloak
exactly sickle evil is an independent force that exists outside of people that acts upon people
I really believe that I've experienced a lot and it's obvious and what vessel
do they choose the weak it's weak men and women who are instruments of evil
the weaker the leader the more evil that leader will be so it's and unfortunately
we've reached a time in American history where every leader is either a woman or a weak man pretty much and so there's
I'm sorry to say it that's just true and the weaker the leader that's why Mike Johnson everyone's like oh Mike Johnson's such a nice guy well I know
Mike Johnson and he's perfectly nice guy to the exent that he's like polite and seems kind of Meek and restrained and
he's not saying [ __ ] every ever you know what I mean he's got like very sort of button- down affect um but he's
he's a weak man and that's the man you should be afraid of the people who you shouldn't be less afraid of are the you
know headstrong loud don't care what anybody thinks yeah those guys will go off track but they're probably not going
to bet you know genocide or blow up the world in a nuclear exchange because they
might they may be obnoxious but they know who they are weak people just become a host for evil you know uh an an
open empty building that evil occupies possesses even um and that's exactly
what's happening to Mike Johnson it's like absolutely crazy what Mike Johnson is doing but it's not because he's evil
it's because he's weak and therefore susceptible to evil it's a meaningful distinction that I have noticed it is a
very strange thing how many weak people wind up being leaders
in this society and particularly because so many people don't want their live exposed they don't want that eye of
Sauron gazing down upon them if they try to run for president I get it or the physical threat yeah physical I mean
look at what's happening to the RFK where the Biden Administration for the first time ever denied him secrets
service protection it's absolutely as a legitimate presidential candidate well it's absolutely nuts yeah I mean how is
that I mean it's hard you know you realize that a lot of the things that we took for granted were actually voluntary
like people just didn't do things because like that's just wrong that's not fair you know what I mean that's bad
sportsmanship like there was a lot of like self-restraint involved in running a functional Society you can't kind of
in you can't just make an infinite number of laws and enforce them that's impossible you rely on people to just
not do bad [ __ ] because like I'm not the kind of person who does bad [ __ ] mhm and once the people in charge decide well
I'm just going to do whatever I want not a lot you can do about it so the B Administration denies him Secret Service
protection and you're like how can you do that like well we're doing it what are you going to do about it [ __ ] and
like the answer is nothing actually what is this most recent bill that they're trying to pass uh about the ability to
monitor phones well it's just the nightmare scenario um it's something that they've
already capable of doing because they did it to you and they did it through an encrypted app oh they do oh yeah how do
they do it do you know how they use how they got into your phone um well there
are two ways to do it's it's interesting and I was I was with Ed Snowden um in Moscow and talked a lot about this
because he's got the technical he's first of all an excellent and principled person and his his exfeed is a really
good place to start for people to understand what's Happening Here um he's paid a huge price for being on
obviously for he's literally exiled to Moscow um involuntarily but uh there are
a couple ways to do it um one you know you could hack into signal I guess it's
open source um it was created with CIA money as I'm sure you know I'm not sure
that's how you I don't think you need to do that you just capture the phone itself you just capture the phone and
the bottom line on digital security is that nothing is safe from State actors
who want to spy on you period there's no there's no electronic communication that they can't monitor period what about
these things like Eric Prince has some new phone out I think it's called unplugged yeah Eric is a good friend of
mine and I've I I have a couple of those phones and I've talked to him a lot about it and he's a really a wonderful
person one of my favorite people actually um but that that phone is is
designed for a different purpose I think I know and that that phone is designed to keep uh Apple and Google from
tracking you which is sort of a separate category like um was this Jimmy this is
the bill I believe I think which Bill the one you're were talking about oh okay house bill on
72 can we just roll down to what you highlighted so this is like a perfect example so um the Turner heims
Bill Congressman Mike Turner and Jim heims so who are Mike Turner and Jim
heims so it just be funny both those guys are the
most and who knows why and you can sort of fill in the blank on motive I'm not going to but those are two of the most
reliable water carriers for the Intel agencies and for basically the federal
bureaucracy in the Congress like these are not people who are working for their constituents these are people who are working for permanent Washington I would
say these are two of the most Sinister people I know more about Turner than Hees um but so it's not surprising
they're doing this it would permit federal law enforcement to also Force any other service provider with access to Communications equipment to hand over
data anyone with access to a Wi-Fi router server or even phone anyone from a landlord to a laundromat will be
required to help the government spy so that's the story right there so basically warrantless of course
warrantless absolutely and in you know violation of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution as if anyone cares anymore
no one does clearly but I just remember when I was a kid and we're roughly the same generation you remember this too
people be like oh East Germany like there are more spies than there are people East Germany was like the most elaborate surveillance State ever
created and of course it collapsed but we always make fun of East Germany or North Korea who do who has more privacy the
average North Korean or the average American well obviously the average North Korean because there's less technology the US government spies on
its own population more than the North Korean government spies on its that's just a fact I'm not saying North Korea
is preferable I'm not moving there I'm not carrying water for North Korea what I'm doing is criticizing my government
because I live here because it was better it can be better it should be better and it only will be when we demand it and it's not some [ __ ]
esoteric like you have to be some crazy civil liberties lawyer or something like
every person should demand just as a starting point a baseline that no you
you're not allowed to spy on me I didn't do do anything wrong right like what right no privacy no Humanity you can't
be fully human without privacy and you also have to take into consideration that these people that are ahead of
these intelligence agencies that are requesting these data are just they're just human beings they're human beings
requesting data from other human beings without going through a court without going to a judge and getting a warrant
without stating a case without having like some clear National Security
mandate something of course not and there's no justification I mean by the way we had fisa we've had the fisa the
foreign intelligence surveillance act since I think 1977 so it predates 9/11
did it stop 911 oh I don't think it did shut the [ __ ] up you're not protecting us actually you open the southern border
to anyone who wants to come you're not checking IDs you're not doing any kind of Biometrics you're not even screening for covid so clearly you don't care
about my safety stop telling me you do you don't you're a criminal stop this a
you don't care about my safety so using my safety as a pretext for spying me is
not going to fly cuz I'm not that stupid I may be kind of stupid I'm not that stupid no you're doing this for one
simple reason because this is what organizations do they protect themselves they exist for their own benefit all
human organizations from the church bake sale committee to the Department of Justice they all are the same they're an
organism just like any other and an organism's main goal is is to survive and reproduce to get bigger and you just
see this throughout the federal bureaucracy well just so happens that the largest human organization in history is the federal government of the
United States and so all of this stuff benefits it it acrs to its own power
that's like like let's say you believed every quote piece of science or scientific Claim about global climate
change you would not reach the same policy conclusions you be like well the first thing we need to do is Ban private
air travel because obviously that doesn't make any sense and then the second thing we need to do is you know whatever you you'd look at it rationally
from a scientific if if you bought the premise which I don't but if you did you would that no you go through every
climate quote climate demand not one of them disempowers large organizations
whether it's NOS or the government of the United States not one of them they all make the government more powerful
and they all make you less powerful so that's when you know it's not really about the temperature of the Earth's
atmosphere it's about making them more powerful and disempowering you and it's not about who runs those agencies the
bigger the agency the more effective it will be in doing what all human organizations do which is protect
themselves and increase their power it's like that it's fundamental I guess that's what I'm saying it's not about oh elect Trump it'll change no it'll only
change when like we're just eliminating the CIA and we're going to have like a small Intel Gathering service that feeds
the president relevant information so we can make inform foreign policy decisions but we're not going to we're not going
to like overturn elections in other countries in the name of democracy because that's insane if we believe in
democracy then we're going to let people vote for their own leaders because we believe in democracy as a principle
right like you just get rid of all this [ __ ] because it's not helping us it's only hurting us and um it would take
someone uh you know who'd be willing to be assassinated to do anything like that and so is is you're choosing your
leaders ask yourself does this person mean it enough to die and that's the same question you ask about your own dad
does he love me enough to die for me about your own husband does he love me enough to protect me from a home home Invader at risk to himself like the the
basic prerequisite for leadership is love of the people you lead and the willingness to die for them and if you
don't have that you shouldn't be leading period it's true in the military it's true in business it's true in your home
and it's true in the government and so no president will fix this unless he's like literally willing to die for it and
short of that it can't be fixed I could think of no better way to end this conversation than that Joe
Rogan ladies and gentlemen nailed it well listen man it's been very fun getting to know you I think you are a uh
very you're you're a controversial character in the world but you're
misunderstood and uh I think if people pay attention to your actual work and the things that you talk about I think
you're you're generally a force of good I really believe that I feel like I'm the most conventional person who's ever
lived yeah I don't think I'm radical at all I'm the opposite in this crazy
time someone who's conventional and and wise seems radical maybe I'm hoping for
a better time yeah I think a better time's possible me too I do it's just uh
we're in for a rough ride yeah I'm not I'm not disarming anytime soon sorry yeah thank you Tucker
thanks Jeff bye everybody
